### Vygotskyan conceptions of learning

#### Stetsenko’s theory of collaborative transformative practice

 (Stetsenko, 2008) is described (Sugarman & Sokol, 2012, pp. 6–8) in Stetsenko’s theory of a dialectic of collaborative transformation of the objective world and of subjectivity and inter-subjectivity. However, the concept of transformation here is analogous to sculpting and does not refer to the transformation of the causal ontology of the world.
