### Social change aligned with self-education of humanity

The problematic of social change has always been central to social theory. I argue that social change is aligned with the self-education of humanity.

### Social movements and mechanisms of change

Environmental vs communicative mechanisms Examples of "womens's liberation" "Environmentalism" and civil rights movements.

See MacAdam et al and Lupia, 2003, Who is Competent

### Autonomy and efficacy

The drive for autonomy of the developing child promotes the appropriation of the role of educator to the self and peer group, allowing the reconfiguring of the causal relationship between the social and the efficacy of mental processes.

    See Collaborative and friendship  Circles & (Shenk, 2014) & compare Fred Dallmayr, Ontology, (non-identity or deconstructionist version), reification, Adorno, Gadamer. Note 1, page 11: Dallmayr uses `Ontology' to mean the `world-context of human thought and action.'
    This meaning is taken primarily from Heidegger's notion of `being in the world'. On page 2 it is noted that Gadamer emphasised `ontology' against Habermas' claims for the autonomy of critical reason. Gadamer championed `historicity' while Habermas came to rely on `quasi-objectivist structures and categories (like labor and domination)' p.3. Dallmayr is referring to early Habermas (in his debate with Gadamer.) & cf. (A. Bandura, 2000, 2004; Albert Bandura, 1995, 2006), also (Romme, Zollo, & Berends, 2010) on deliberate types of learning in organizations. Also see (Leontiev, 1932) note p.4 “independence” and “effort”, ‘The Development of Voluntary Attention’ regarding independence from external stimuli.

### Reconfiguring causal relationship between social and mental

The reconfiguring of the causal relationship between the social and the efficacy of mental processes

### Interaction of the mental and social

Ekström explains that the generative conception of causality in social science focuses on discovering causal properties underlying "the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions, meanings, intentions, social contexts and structures" and the social actions which result from this interaction. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

```
    This relates to "The causal efficacy of mental states" (Menzies, 2003)
```

### Autonomy, solidarity, collaboration, inquiry, efficacy

### Methodology of causally explanatory social theory

Ekström poses the question as to what can we identify as the "scientific-theoretical and methodological foundations" of social theory directed toward causal explanations. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

## Bildung

### Herder's concept of Bildung

Herder developed the concept of “self-cultivation (Selbst-Bildung)” within the notion of “cultivating mankind” through his reading of Shaftesbury, Leibniz, Montesquieu, Spalding, Möser, Wieland, and the authors Sterne and Richardson (Horlacher, 2004)

### Hegel's concept of Bildung

### Adorno's Bildungsidee

For Adorno the Bildungsidee was a the understanding of the development of freedom through self-development consonant with Leibniz’s interpretation of Shaftesbury’s “character formation” as development of “inward form” or “innere Bildung” and Goethe’s authenticity and “self-creation” (Hermeling, 2003).

### Vygotskyan conceptions of learning

For Vygotsky it is by addressing, through collaborative activity, the problems encountered in daily life, that one develops oneself and becomes a knowledgeable member of a community (Blunden, 2015).

#### Stetsenko’s theory of collaborative transformative practice

```
(Stetsenko, 2008) is described (Sugarman & Sokol, 2012, pp. 6–8) in Stetsenko’s theory of a dialectic of collaborative transformation of the objective world and of subjectivity and inter-subjectivity. However, the concept of transformation here is akin that of Archer in that it is analogous to sculpting and does not refer to the transformation of the causal ontology of the world.

### Engeström’s conception of learning

### Bickhard’s interactivist model of learning

### Efficacy and ontology in education and social action

See Martin, Sugarman & Hickinbottom, 2010, *Persons: Understanding Psychological Selfhood and Agency* regarding agency and the emergent ontology of persons.
