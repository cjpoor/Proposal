## Introduction

### Theoretical Context

    Frank Deer et al, especially Chris Hrynkow's work on transformative socio-ecological learning, have highlighted educational approaches to sustainability issues, (Hrynkow, 2014 in Deer et al). Similarly, Ron Miller brought together research on educational responses to ecological crisis (R. Miller, 1998). Yrjö Engeström utilizes cultural-historical activity theory of Vygotsky and Leont’ev to develop the concept of "knotworking" in developmental work research (Engeström, 2000) while Mark Bickard and colleagues have developed an action-based framework for modeling the development of persons (Allen & Bickhard, 2013).


    ### Thesis
    By studying the achievements of ancient Athens we may become aware of alternative possibilities in our own history. At those junctures when a decisively different direction was taken, the structural groundwork was laid for either democracy or despotism. Switching tracks would then require the overthrow of the existing structures through either a concerted effort by elites or the gathering of popular support for progressive revolution. [Compare the fate of Bhukarin, the Levellers, the Massachussets rebels with Allende and Chavez, Kennedy and Kruschev, Whitlam and Lange, Lumumba and Soekhano, Bretton Woods and IMF 2012. ]

    [\(Gare, 2005\)](#Gare2005)p.5 Reference to the idea of knowledge as a "conversation among a community" emphasis in original. This accords with the contested nature of knowledge in physics and many other areas of endeavour and contradicts the "banking" concept of education as storing up "facts."

    ### Conclusion

    ### Supporting Arguments
    Human nature - Aristotle, Freire, Arendt. Political action in some form is necessary for a person to experience autonomy [here critique common ed. understanding of autonomy as internalized authority] and autonomy is a essential aspect of a human as such. It follows that autonomy should be encouraged as an essential part of a person's education.Self-education of humanity  --  Institutional and societal learningRole of current education system in fostering obedience and habit and furthering the role of social capital.Hegemonic discourse and 'reforms.' Autonomy and accountability of educators and ed. institutions.Critical realist theory of education.

    ### The Self-Education of Humanity
    ----------------------Feenberg, A. (2014). The Philosophy of Praxis: Marx, LukÃ¡cs and the Frankfurt School. Verso London. * Highlight, page 13Like the early Marx, the early Marxist LukÃ¡cs is a critic of the “alienation of reason” in modern capitalist society. But that critique is by no means irrationalist; rather, it aims at the establishment of a dialectical paradigm of rationality suited to the task of social self- understanding and human liberation.* Anchored Note, page 13Feenberg on Lukacs concept of social self-understandingThis concept of social self-understanding is analogous to Hegel's self-education of humanity.* Highlight, page 17Marx's startling innovation was to include all the antinomies in his theory of revolution, those relating to epistemology and ontology as well as the moral and political ones. He thus arrived at the astounding proposition that social change could not only accomplish such goals as reconciling individual and society, moral responsibility and self-interest, but that it could also unite subject and object, thought and being, man and nature.* Anchored Note, page 17Feenberg, The Philosophy of Praxis, p.17Here, by seeing all antinomies as recoverable through revolution, Marx had a theory of "turning the world upside down."---From lecture referring to forthcoming book:... LukÃ¡cs reached the startling conclusion that a transformation of social reality can alter the form of rationality and the nature of reality ...cf. p.15 of book:Because traditional philosophy assumes that the alienated foundations of the social order are rooted in the very nature of reality, it concludes that the antinomies can only be resolved speculatively, in thought, and formulates them in view of such a resolution. The criterion of philosophical adequacy that guides concept formation in the tradition thus reflects an implicit sense of the limits of social change that Marx and LukÃ¡cs challenge. They argue that the resolution of the antinomies requires a radical social transformation unimagined by their predecessors.------------------

## self-education as History Making

### Ancient Greece

    The concept of the self-education of humanity has been an underlying theme in the work of thinkers at least since Thucydides and Aristotle.

## Athenian Democracy

    1,000 Words---------------My Notes on Dehaene, Reading in the BrainAdaptation of shape recognition area of the brain for word recognition parallels adaptation of behaviour seen in primates such as hierarchical domination (Baboons) and cooperation (Bonobos "While social hierarchies do exist, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies." & "The brain anatomy of bonobos has more developed and larger regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety, which makes them less aggressive and more empathic than their close relatives. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which helps control impulses. This thicker connection may make them better in regulating their emotional impulses and behavior." - Wikipedia - latter excerpt quotes WashingtonPost.com 12-4-2011) to similar behaviour in human societies - tribes and hunter-gatherer communities respectively. The latter would be what Marx described as "primitive communist" and existed for perhaps hundreds of millenia before tribes and their elites came to dominate human existence. Is it possible that humans in hierarchical societies have had to adapt brain patterns that were developed early in our evolution as primates to supersede those developed as apes?socio-ontological fluxcompare Melting Point by Eric Dorfman which describes a situation of socio-ontological flux brought about by changes in the physical world (brought on by human activity).p.125 Invariance and realism."In the course of evolution, the brain was undoubtedly subjected to intense selective pressures that obliged it to arrive at an invariant perception of the world. We know that invariance is an essential characteristic of the inferior temporal lobe."see also pp.138ff.p.160 'Voting' for words or letters in brain very similar to bee democracy.p.174 Neuronal recycling hypothesis opposed to cultural relativism - supports realism.p.185 Writing complex - requires memorization of hundreds of characters - Emergence of elite.p.190 80% illiteracy in China until great simplification of characters and massive expenditure on education in 1950s - down to 10%.p.191 Letters of Roman alphabet contain hidden pictographs from four thousand years ago when writing was invented (see p.183).p.192. With the alphabet, a greater level democracy came to writing.Elites required the spread of literacy to their bureaucracy but efforts to overcome ambiguity increased the complexity of the scripts in Sumeria, Egypt and China (pp.188-9) although this complexity paralleled the topology of the brain (pp.189-90).p.190-1 Innovation (probably by groups on the periphery of existing society) led to simplification through the advantage of late development - borrowing characters to represent speech sounds. "Finally, they gave up ideographic writing and concentrated exclusively on the abstract notation of speech sounds and word roots." (Note 202 - p.339 - refers to similarity of development of the elegant Hangul writing system in Korea in 1446.) NB Elite control and exploitation of large agricultural population requires literate bureaucracy. System logic leads to increasing complexity and obscuranticism. Control is problematic at periphery where mixing of ideas leads to innovation allowing development and introduction of more democratic forms of literacy following logic of lifeworld, ideal speech and the brain. Spread of innovation (contagion) follows inevitably from increased communication (often led by trade).Compare introduction of printing press (in West vs. invention in China - ) - innovations leading to democratization of internet and elite efforts to regain and impose control and exploit.-----------------

        With no previous example to build upon, the ancient Greeks taught themselves how to establish, maintain, and defend a democratic Polis.
        Ober analyzes the institutions and mechanisms developed and employed by the ancient Athenians to build and protect democracy (Knowledge and democracy, 2007).

## Notes on Ober, 2008, Knowledge and democracy.

    pp.9 ff. Ober introduces the concepts of "collective action, coordination, and common pool resources" from game theory to frame his analysis of the institutions of democracy in ancient Athens. The last of these refers to the problem of "the tradegy of the commons" (compare empirical arguments eg. The successful management of New Foundland fisheries by local fishermen). Note also criticism of game theory by D Cohen esp 1995, Law violence and community in classical Athens.
    p.14 Discusses cooperation between states - ref to Mackil and to Mackil and van Alfen. Also ref to "state of nature" critiqued by Nussbaum, 2006, Frontiers of Justice, ch.1.
    p15 note 24: power and the meaning attached to symbols.
    p.16 n.26 comparative economic performance of democratic states - refs.
    p.17: Hypothesis.
    pp.17-1 ref to Hayek on dispersed knowledge.

    To what extent were these institutions supported by norms in Athenian culture?

#### Autonomy in ancient Athens

##### Autonomy and Democracy

        "Athenian culture placed an extraordinary emphasis on personal autonomy" (Konstan 1995:334)The ancient Athenians considered individual autonomy to be an integral quality of a citizen. (note on p.334)"Horace demonstrates that expected of a client is incompatible with genuine indepenthe behavior the ideal of libertas or lrappflGia dence and frankness, as represented by" (Konstan 1995:341)Horace argues that true friendship requires mutual independence in material matters so that a client and patron cannot really be friends. (note on p.341)"Where earlier conceptions of friendship, during the period of the Athenian democracy, emphasized the social equality of the partners, later thinkers put the stress on integrity and frankness, which was incumbent upon friends without regard for rank and station. Such a relationship was compatible with the hierarchical structure of clientship, provided that the partners took care to preserve the honesty and mutuality that friendship entails. But the idea of friend was never reduced to that of patron or client." (Konstan 1995:342)

        To a far greater degree than the Romans, the ancient Athenians considered individual autonomy to be an integral quality of a citizen. Athenian democracy was grounded on "an ideology of equality" (Konstan, 1995, Patrons and Friends). Ober notes that, in contrast to most other pre-modern societies, the elties generally had very little in the way of networks of private patronage (Knowledge, p.255).

        Castoriadis (1991, Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy) argues that, almost uniquely, the ancient Athenian culture "burst" open the bonds of institutionalized heteronomy, allowing the genuine development of the autonomous individual who was able, in turn, to act on society in the "self-alteration of the social world ... this relation appears during manifest and marked epochs of social-historical alteration when society and individuals alter themselves together, those alterations entailing each other ..." (p.146)


            >Starting with the psyche, using it, as it were, as a material, the instituted society each time makes the individuals-which, as such, can henceforth only make the society which has made them. It is only insofar as the radical imagination of the psyche seeps through the successive layers of the social armor, which cover and penetrate it up to an unfathomable limit-point, and which constitute the individual, that the singular human being can have, in return, an independent action on society. Let me note, in anticipation of what follows, that such an action is extremely rare and, at any rate, imperceptible wherever instituted heteronomy6 prevails­ that is, in fact, in almost all known societies. In this case, apart from the bundle of predefined social roles, the only ascertainable ways in which the singular psyche can manifest itself are transgression and pathology. Things are different in the rare case of societies where the bursting of complete heteronomy makes a true individuation of the individual possible and thus allows the radical imagination of the singular psyche to find or create the social means of publicly expressing itself in an original manner and to contribute perceptibly to the self-alteration of the social world. A third aspect of this relation appears during manifest and marked epochs of social-historical alteration when society and individuals alter themselves together, those alterations entailing each other in this case. (p.146)


        A section of the elite, however was always ambitious to impose their own rule, and in this they succeeded twice, though temporarily. Furthermore, political theorists and philosophers, from Plato to Robert Bellah and John Keane, have pointed to the dark side of democracy, warning of problems of hubris and oppression of minorities. What lessons can we learn from the Greek experience for our continuing self-education in defence of democracy today?

## The Enlightenments of East and West

    Need to summarize Wokler, 2003 on timeline and theorists re Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment pp.1-8 here.

    Enlightenment thinkers argued against imperialism. [\(Muthu, 2009\)](@muthu_enlightenment_2009)


### The Lost Enlightenment

    p.12 Polymath Farabi of Kazakhstan theorised on "the ideal city"p.13 The universal applicability of rules of reason was widely agreed upon by the thinkers of Central Asia in anticipation of the Newtonian scientific revolution nearly one thousand years later.p.37 ref. to Karl Wittfogel's concept of "hydraulic civilization" (from his Oriental Despotism).Compares the hierarchical organization of irrigation in China, India, Mexico, Mesopotamia, and Central Asia to the neighbourhood projects typical of Ancient Greece (which, Starr tells us, helped produce the Greek civic culture).  see also p.39 "... rigorously hierarchical and strictly regulated social systems ..."[Note the dynamic through which surplus in production allows the emergence of an intellectual elite, some members of which may promote progressive social ideas. The surplus is usually produced by exploited slaves or workers but need not necessarily depend on a hierarchical exploitative system.]p.59. Cosmopolitan outlook of the Central Asian intellectuals due to large and numerous cities and inhospitable countryside.p.60 Power of urban rulers produced stability that fostered a certain free-thinking perspective among city dwellers (according to Russian historian Vasilii Bartold).pp.62-3 Bartold's observation on freedom of thought is corroborated by the conclusion of Dzhalilov that literacy was widespread [apparently even among servants] in Central Asia before the Arab conquest.p.73 The appropriation and formalisation of Zoroastrianism as a state religion by Sassanian Persia empowered a priestly elite and alienated commoners who became open to newer religions.p.96 In Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Christianity, the major belief systems of the region between Zoroastrianism and Islam, the common people were able to express their faith by performing the religious rites themselves.p.97f.

### The Radical Enlightenment

### The Counter Enlightenment

    "Critics have long treated the most important intellectual movement of modern history - the Enlightenment - as if it took shape in the absence of opposition. This groundbreaking study demonstrates that contemporary resistance to the Enlightenment was a major cultural force, shaping and defining the Enlightenment itself from the moment of its inception and giving rise to an entirely new ideological phenomenon - what we have come to think of as the "Right." Born in France, but spread throughout Europe and the New World in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Counter-Enlightenment was neither a rarefied current in the history of ideas nor an atavistic relic of the past, but an extensive, international, and thoroughly modern affair." "Drawing on a wide range of primary sources, Darrin M. McMahon shows that well before the French Revolution, enemies of the Enlightenment were warning that the secular thrust of modern philosophy would give way to horrors of an unprecedented kind. Greeting 1789, in turn, as the realization of their worst fears, they fought the Revolution from its onset, profoundly affecting its subsequent course. The radicalization - and violence - of the Revolution was as much the product of militant resistance as any inherent logic."--BOOK JACKET. [\(McMahon, 2001\)](@mcmahon_enemies_2001)

### Conclusion

## Participatory and Deliberative Democracy

     1,000 Words
     The ability of a group or organisation to learn depends on the kind of talk that is encouraged within the group. Conversation between individuals can be the source of deep questioning and assessment of ideas, old and new but is limited to participation by a few agents at a time. Announcements, pronouncements and declaratory speech are one-way communications which limit learning to the dissemination of information and opinions from the few (usually elite) to the many. This is typical of many old-style conferences. Discussion or debate of the kind referred to in conceptions of the 'public sphere' and 'deliberative democracy' may allow the group to benefit from the in-depth and iterative nature of conversation while encouraging participation of all members in the process of self-education of the organisation. - This depends on appropriate rules and mores - often these exist in traditional societies but have been displaced by deference to authority and privatism in modern societies. The Greens generally practise appropriate discussion procedure for group learning - cf. Russel Norman's thesis and compare Habermas' TCA and speech acts.

### The Greek Example

### Workers Educational Associations

    Haferkamp, H., & Smelser, N. J. (1992). Social change and modernity. University of California press Berkeley.Verbatim quote from section by Klaus Eder (Contradictions and Social Evolution: A Theory of the Social Evolution of Modernity)p.326 (p.180 of pdf)----------Begin verbatim quoteIn all these groups a reflexive use of communication is practiced. As people learn to communicate about communication, they revolutionize the traditional order. The evolution of modern society becomes dependent on the communication that is the subject of communicative relationships. Reflexivity in communication is the starting point for the social production of modern society. Those who participate in modern associations know that they are taking part in a collective learning process. In the AufklÃ¤rungsgesellschaften of the eighteenth century (the Jacobin clubs were their radical variants), the Arbeiterbildungsvereine of the nineteenth century (the associations for the self-education of the workers), and the therapy groups of the late-twentieth century, the function of learning has become part of the process of communication. The mechanism constituting the modern associations since the eighteenth century can therefore be defined as discursive communication.[19]The form of communication practiced in these associations throughout modernity changes the form and the content of the learning processes taking place in these associations. Thus the idea of an evolutionary new type of learning is the theoretical key to the cultural consequences of the emergence of associations since the beginning of modern society. Cultural change in modern society is produced by a collective learning process whose logic is defined by the logic of discursive communication.For a controversial discussion of the social-structural basis of the new social movements see Offe 1985; Bourdieu 1984.The concept of discursive communication has been elaborated by Habermas (1981).End-----------Eder is characterising the learning processes in cooperative and workers' organizations as a discursive process depending on self-conscious development of collective communicative facility. His concept is one of cultural evolution in society through such collective learning taking place in voluntary associations such as the Jacobin Clubs and Arbeiterbildungsvereine whose equivalent in the anglophone world would be the Workers' Educational Associations.[compare the cultural development of reading and writing and its shaping of the brain - Reading in The Brain - Dehaene]

### Welfare State Institutions

    The genetically programmed vigilance against injustice and cheating referred to by Robert Wright (Nonzero, p.24) may be undermined by the universal provision in welfare states. This vigilance may promote moral indignation at injustice but it also involves argument to the point of bickering over distribution of goods and obligations. One aim of universalism is to undermine the distrust that is an ingredient of such vigilance.
        (my zydea: Trust Grounded in Welfare Universalism versus Instinctive Vigilance)
    Compare "Social inequality threatens the democratic project because it destroys the trust on which governments depend, and it gives rise to corrupt political and economic institutions." from publisher's description of The Problem of Social Inequality [\(_The Problem of Social Inequality_, 2015\)](@2015j)

## Social Change

### Social change aligned with self-education of humanity

    The problematic of social change has always been central to social theory. I argue that social change is aligned with the self-education of humanity.

### Social movements and mechanisms of change

    Environmental vs communicative mechanisms Examples of "womens's liberation" "Environmentalism" and civil rights movements.

        See MacAdam et al and Lupia, 2003, Who is Competent

### Reconfiguring causal relationship between social and mental

    The reconfiguring of the causal relationship between the social and the efficacy of mental processes

### Interaction of the mental and social

    Ekström explains that the generative conception of causality in social science focuses on discovering causal properties underlying "the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions, meanings, intentions, social contexts and structures" and the social actions which result from this interaction. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

        This relates to "The causal efficacy of mental states" (Menzies, 2003)

### Autonomy, solidarity, collaboration, inquiry, efficacy

### Methodology of causally explanatory social theory

    Ekström poses the question as to what can we identify as the "scientific-theoretical and methodological foundations" of social theory directed toward causal explanations. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

## Bildung

### Herder's concept of Bildung

    Herder developed the concept of “self-cultivation (Selbst-Bildung)” within the notion of “cultivating mankind” through his reading of Shaftesbury, Leibniz, Montesquieu, Spalding, Möser, Wieland, and the authors Sterne and Richardson (Horlacher, 2004)

### Hegel's concept of Bildung

### Adorno's Bildungsidee

    For Adorno the Bildungsidee was the understanding of the development of freedom through self-development consonant with Leibniz’s interpretation of Shaftesbury’s “character formation” as development of “inward form” or “innere Bildung” and Goethe’s authenticity and “self-creation” (Hermeling, 2003).

## Learning

### Vygotskyan conceptions of learning

    For Vygotsky it is by addressing, through collaborative activity, the problems encountered in daily life, that one develops oneself and becomes a knowledgeable member of a community (Blunden, 2015).

#### Stetsenko’s theory of collaborative transformative practice

    (Stetsenko, 2008) is described (Sugarman & Sokol, 2012, pp. 6–8) in Stetsenko’s theory of a dialectic of collaborative transformation of the objective world and of subjectivity and inter-subjectivity. However, the concept of transformation here is akin that of Archer in that it is analogous to sculpting and does not refer to the transformation of the causal ontology of the world.

### Engeström’s conception of learning

### Bickhard’s interactivist model of learning

### Efficacy and ontology in education and social action

    See Martin, Sugarman & Hickinbottom, 2010, *Persons: Understanding Psychological Selfhood and Agency* regarding agency and the emergent ontology of persons.

### Progressive Education

#### Dewey

#### Vygotsky

#### New Zealand

### Political Efficacy in Educational Development

### The Example of Porto Alegre

### Autonomy in Knowledge Creation

    Research on computer assisted education has found that, when students involved in "context situated problem based learning" and collaboration take ownership of their learning, they develop more complex thinking patterns than observed in more traditional settings.Lucas et al. quote Lucas and Moreira (2010); and De Wever et al. (2009).

    [SawchukDuarteEtAl2006] Ch.11 p.217 " .. to continue this development at the point reached by the earlier generations ... In the process of "appropriation" (Aneignung) ... the individual transforms into living-personal ... skills the historically created ... abilities [and] ... creates the possibility of history as such." - quoting Markus, 1978, 8.

    pp.218f. critiques radical constructionism of Ernst von Glasersfeld. See quote from Marx: " ... The cultivation of the five senses is the work of all previous history ... "

    Duarte continues: No contradiction between reproduction of society's accumulated knowledge and autonomous learning by the individual.

    p.220 Refers to Marx's dialectical understanding of historical materialism. However, this cyclical process should be replaced with an understanding of history without underlying logic but nonetheless following "power laws." Although this could arguably be the thesis of the ultimate progression to communism via the ultimately alienating capitialism.

    N.B: pp.221f. Leontyev's analysis of the development of the individual through appropriation of socially accumulated knowledge.

    pp.221-2 Leontyev insists that the concept of adaptation to one's environment is entirely inappropriate for understanding psychological development. Education should provide the widest possible vista for development, going well beyond the foreseeable material needs of the present and incorporating all the richness of human culture.

    p.223  -- something of a manifesto for public education --

    pp.223f. Leontyev's "three principal characteristics of the process of appropriation of cultural objects by individuals."

    p.224 "The processes of objectification and appropriation constitute the mediation between the history of humankind and the individual's formation."

    bottom of page: "That is why Leontyev affirms that the mechanisms of individual culture appropriation are "mechanisms of the forming of mechanisms.""

    p.225 This means that learning is not a passive process.

### Conclusion

## Education for the Twenty First Century

     500 Words
     My notesNecessity and potential of revolutionary (democracy from below) change in light of global warming, peak oil and ecological overshoot.Historical examples of similar changes - from environmental causes - from democratic, universalist aspirations (compare Rushkoff, 2011 Life Inc [related], p.93 on citizens relating to corporate image of state versus aspiration to "liberty, equality and fraternity" - also compare Habermas on moral reasoning, communicative action and Weber's Iron Cage of instrumentalism).The role of education in teaching moral reasoning, critical thinking etc. - Compare historical role of Higher Ed versus instrumentalism being imposed in recent times - also "skills" and "training" in high school versus "learning to learn" etc.Revolution as democracy from below.Equality and economic self-determination in cooperatives etc.Fraternity/solidarity in current and older social movements, unions etc.--- The self-education of humanity through struggle for democratic autonomy versus heteronomy. Just as the current climate change is similar to but totally different from previous environmental and systemic disruptions - so the response will (and is) similar but entirely unique - That is: a bottom-up revolutionary struggle for democratic change but with the new methods of the global movements in decentralised approach etc. Also takeover and overthrow of institutions through appropriation by rewriting rules/laws in terms of 'turning the world upside down' - this must of course be thorough-going [how to make this so without top-down coordinated action? - maybe through political leaders such as Greens?]--------Haferkamp, H., & Smelser, N. J. (1992). Social change and modernity.

## Conclusion

    500 Words
    Adaptation of brain - See Reading in the Brain, Stanislas Dehaene - Evolution determines brain structures, culture requires adaptation. Historical Materialism identified primitive communism as the archetypal human society but without the argument from brain adaptation and evolution. Some social forms are in conflict with human nature (which includes the striving for autonomy expressed in democracy struggles) - Compare Mao's Red Army units continuing to predominate in the Chinese government (Tiziano Terzani, Behind the Forbidden Door) and the young Chinese interviewed by David Rice in The Dragon's Brood.Socio-ontological praxis involves the conscious learning of appropriate adaptation through struggles for autonomy and democracy.The ideology and structure of the world system of capitalism in the 21st century steers adaptation towards competitive, acquisitive individualism. However, just as Habermas saw the nature of communication distorted by the system, so are elements of the brain that evolved for hunting and mortal combat with predator species adapted for social life under capitalism. We need, instead to adapt the mental capacities we developed for cooperative, sustainable living to build a new system compatible with those capacities.Emancipation - of people in general and of children - through education (see Rata's papers on knowledge - also science and rationality - Habermas and also eg Scientific Method in Brief - and self-education esp. in public sphere and through democratisation and development of social movements and political parties.RELATED - search google scholar for knowledge + education + emancipation------------Compare personal projects, "career" lasting achievements and contributions with those of social movements etc. and the enlightenment project.------------
