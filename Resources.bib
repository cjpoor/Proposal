  abstract = {Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint, causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions, meanings, intentions, social contexts and structures.},

  abstract = {Overview: Our early ancestors lived in small groups and worked actively to preserve social equality. As they created larger societies, however, inequality rose, and by 2500 BCE truly egalitarian societies were on the wane. In The Creation of Inequality, Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus demonstrate that this development was not simply the result of population increase, food surplus, or the accumulation of valuables. Instead, inequality resulted from conscious manipulation of the unique social logic that lies at the core of every human group. A few societies allowed talented and ambitious individuals to rise in prestige while still preventing them from becoming a hereditary elite. But many others made high rank hereditary, by manipulating debts, genealogies, and sacred lore. At certain moments in history, intense competition among leaders of high rank gave rise to despotic kingdoms and empires in the Near East, Egypt, Africa, Mexico, Peru, and the Pacific. Drawing on their vast knowledge of both living and prehistoric social groups, Flannery and Marcus describe the changes in logic that create larger and more hierarchical societies, and they argue persuasively that many kinds of inequality can be overcome by reversing these changes, rather than by violence.},

Frederick Brown explores the tumultuous forces unleashed by the Dreyfus Affair, and examines how the clashing ideologies and the blood-soaked political scandals and artistic movements following the horror of World War I resulted in the country's era of militant authoritarianism; and how rioting, violent racism, and nationalistic fervor overtook France's sense of reason, sealed its fate, and led to the rise of the Vichy government. We see how the French intelligentsia turned away from the humanistic traditions and rationalistic ideals of the Enlightenment in favor of submission to authority that stressed patriotism, militarism, and xenophobia; how French conservatives attempted to rebuild and reshape the country's collective identity as the German threat loomed, as mistrust of the parliamentary Republic increased (a result of its illegal financial mismanagement of the building of the Panama Canal, and nostalgia for a monarchial government and the glories of wartime martyrdom); how the generation that came of age in the trenches, under fire, offered a new vision, and saw salvation in the surrender of reason to instinct.

@thesis{houle_inequality_2010,
  title = {Inequality, Economic Development, and Democracy},
  abstract = {"Under what conditions do democracies emerge and consolidate? Recent theories suggest that inequality is among the leading determinants of both democratization and consolidation. By contrast, the first chapter of the dissertation argues that inequality harms consolidation but has no net effect on democratization. The author shows that the existing theories that link inequality to democratization suffer from serious limitations: (1) they are useful only for understanding transitions from below and thus do not apply to many transitions (that is, those from above); (2) even for democratization from below, their predictions are unlikely to hold, since inequality actually has two opposite effects; and (3) they ignore collective action problems, which reduces their explanatory power. However, these objections do not affect the relationship between inequality and consolidation. In particular, while inequality has two opposite effects on the probability of transition to democracy, it unambiguously increases the probability of transition away from democracy. This chapter conducts the most comprehensive empirical test of the relationship between inequality and democracy to date. It finds no support for the main democratization theories. Contrary to what they predict, estimation suggests neither a monotonic negative nor an inverted U-shaped relationship. Yet inequality increases the probability of backsliding from democracy to dictatorship. In addition, this chapter offers the first explanation of why inequality has more influence on the consolidation of democratic regimes than on their creation. The second chapter of the dissertation further addresses the questions of what are the economic conditions most favorable to democratization. Although multiple theories have argued that the economic conditions under which a country finds itself are somehow related to its chances of democratization, so far these claims have received little empirical support. In particular, empirical studies have failed to find any systematic relationship between economic development, on the one hand, and the likelihood of democratization, on the other hand. Similarly, in Chapter 1 I show that economic inequality has no effect on transition to democratization. Building on the argument proposed in the first chapter, I argue that the reason why previous theories have been unable to uncover the true effect of inequality and development on democratization is that they have assumed that both of these factors affect democratization independently of one another. Yet, income distribution has different meanings and consequences at different income levels, and vice versa. In this chapter, I combine, for the first time, modernization and inequality theories of democratization and show that inequality affects democratization differently at different levels of development. In middle income countries inequality fosters democratization; in poor and rich countries, however, it inhibits democratization. Extensive cross-national analysis strongly suggests that the effect of inequality on transition to democracy depends on economic development. This chapter contributes to the literature notably by proposing and testing a new economic theory of democratization. While the first chapter found that inter-class inequality destabilizes democracy, it also found that some democracies with equal income distribution, such as Niger and Uganda, have nonetheless collapsed. Most of these exceptions are African countries that are ethnically diverse. The third chapter addresses questions about the relationship between class and ethnic cleavages. For example, is inequality more harmful when it reinforces other cleavages? Does the effect of inequality between ethnic groups somehow depend on the level of inequality within ethnic groups, and vice versa? This chapter answers these questions by solving a formal model that distinguishes between intra- and inter-ethnic inequality. I argue that democracy is most unstable when either intra-ethnic inequality is high and inter-ethnic inequality is low, or when intra-ethnic inequality is low and inter-ethnic inequality is high. When ethnicity is salient, what matters most is not the absolute level of inequality but the relative levels of intra- and inter-ethnic inequality. I conduct the very first cross-national test of the effect of inequality between and within ethnic groups on democratic consolidation. Using an original data set on ethnic inequality in 26 African democracies between 1980 and 2005, I find strong evidence supporting my hypothesis. Among other things, these findings suggest that the reason why some democracies have been unstable despite having low inter-class inequality is that their levels of inter-ethnic inequality were high."--Leaves v-vii.},

Without denying a role for Algaze's factors, I suggest that ever-present risks of subsistence variability were probably more decisive in encouraging social stratification and a higher degree of regimentation within locally contending city-states there. Enhanced military effectiveness then surely played a part, alongside trade and possibly overshadowing it, in ensuing regional dominance.},

Focusing on the process of market reform in U.S. healthcare during the last thirty years, this study finds systematic variation in the dimensions used to differentiate discourse on organizational forms such as hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and nursing homes. Discourse in the sector suggests that the symbolic integration of forms along the dimension of accessibility during the heyday of welfare state policies has given way to symbolic integration along clinical and functional dimensions with the rise of neoliberal ideologies. These segregating and blending processes are discussed as a general response to uncertainty and the desire for ontological security among organizational actors.},

are relatively automatic and driven by the stimuli, versus those that are more deliberative and

By the late 1930s, the  macrostructure' of his realist system was in place. It includes a theory of process and a substantial metaphysics, one that opposes positivism, linguistic philosophy and all forms of idealism. However, beyond Australia it remains largely unknown, despite its bearing on a number of current issues in psychology and the social sciences generally. This article outlines Anderson's transition from Hegelian idealism to realism, describes aspects of his ontology and epistemology, compares some of Anderson's ideas with Dewey's pragmatism and explains their relevance to present-day psychology.},

Sociocultural views of know ing and learning are an influential force in this movement. In this article I apply the sociocul tural assumption that knowledge resides in con texts of its use to the study of achievement mo tivation. I then use this "participatory" view of knowing and learning to define a stridently so ciocultural approach to "motivationincontext." I contrast conventional behavioral and cognitive assumptions about engagement with the socio cultural notion of engaged participation in the coconstruction of standards and values in learn ing contexts. I also explore the complex issue of reconciliation between individual and social ac tivity that is critical to contextual considerations of motivation. The conventional aggregative ap proach to reconciliation is compared to the dia lectical approach that follows from a sociocul tural perspective. Finally, I discuss the potential value of this model and approach in terms of the new perspective they offer for persistent educa tion questions, such as use of extrinsic rewards to motivate engagement in learning.},

@incollection{bickhard_social_2004,
  title = {The Social Ontology of Persons},
  abstract = {Publisher's blurb and TOC 
Written by highly respected theorists in psychology and philosophy, the chapters in this book explicate and address fundamental epistemological issues involved in the problem of the relationship between the individual and the collective. Different theoretical viewpoints are presented on this relationship, as well as between the nature of rationality and morality, relativism and universalism, and enculturation and internalization. Many chapters also highlight similarities and differences between these alternative frameworks and Piaget's theory, and thus correct the misperception that Piaget had nothing to say about the social dimension of development. Other chapters focus on the implications of these debates for the important topic areas of pedagogy, moral development, and the development of social understanding in infancy and childhood. Although Piaget's theory is presented and evaluated by some of the chapters in this collection, the authors remain critical and do not shy away from revising or extending Piaget's theory whenever it is deemed necessary.

Though the topic covered in this book is of fundamental importance in the social sciences, it is rarely addressed in a sustained way as it is in this collection of chapters. The book benefits social scientists interested in fundamental epistemological issues, especially as these concern the relationship between the individual and the collective, with implications for the conceptualization of morality and rationality.

  title = {Curriculum Change and Teacher Resistance},
  abstract = {Educational change in New Zealand has been a hot topic in 2012. We have faced cutbacks, closures, charter schools and league tables, not to mention the ‘rejuvenation and consolidation’ of Christchurch schools following the 2010/2011 earthquakes. A common reaction has been resistance—from teachers, principals, teacher unions, academics and, in the cases of class sizes and the Christchurch closures and amalgamations, also from parents and boards of trustees.

In many centres, classrooms, schools and tertiary institutions, teachers might respond to top-down change with immediate outrage, deliberate avoidance, partial adoption, major adaptation, sneaky subversion or even quiet revolution. When we trust teachers and educational leaders to make decisions based on their professional judgement, these acts are more likely to be thoughtful and positive rather than negative and detrimental.

It is these positive acts of thoughtful critique that this issue of Curriculum Matters celebrates. While some authors in this this issue take an overt and deliberate stand against current curricular and educational policy directions, others quietly keep progressive ideals alive through their creative, reflective and innovative practices.},

  shorttitle = {Democracy in the {{Making}}},
  abstract = {With civic engagement commonly understood to be on the decline and traditional bases of community and means of engagement increasingly fractured, how do people become involved in collective civic action? How do activist groups form? What hampers the ability of these groups to invigorate political life, and what enables it?Kathleen Blee's groundbreaking new study provides a provocative answer: the early times matter. By following grassroots groups from their very beginnings, Blee traces how their sense of possibility shrinks over time as groups develop a shared sense of who they are that forecloses options that were once open. At the same time, she charts the turning points at which options re-open and groups become receptive to change and reinvention.Based on observing more than sixty grassroots groups in Pittsburgh for three years, Democracy in the Making is an unprecedented look at how ordinary people come together to change society. It gives a close-up look at the deliberations of activists on the left and right as they work for animal rights, an end to the drug trade in their neighbourhood, same-sex marriage, global peace, and more. It shows how grassroots activism can provide an alternative to civic disengagement and a forum for envisioning how the world can be transformed. At the same time, it documents how activist groups become mired in dysfunctional and undemocratic patterns that their members dislike, but cannot fix.By analyzing the possibilities and pitfalls that face nascent activist organizations, Blee reveals how critical early choices are to the success of grassroots activism. Vital for scholars and activists alike, this practical yet profound study shows us, through the examples of both groups that flourish and those that flounder, how grassroots activism can better live up to its democratic potential.},

In fact, they were from Central Asia--drawn from the Persianate and Turkic peoples of a region that today extends from Kazakhstan southward through Afghanistan, and from the easternmost province of Iran through Xinjiang, China. Lost Enlightenment recounts how, between the years 800 and 1200, Central Asia led the world in trade and economic development, the size and sophistication of its cities, the refinement of its arts, and, above all, in the advancement of knowledge in many fields. -- Publisher website.},

And the process of creating new mathematics is just that, an artistic pursuit--a deeply personal experience, which requires passion, dedication, and love.

To be human is to want to know, to understand our origins and the meaning of our lives. In The Island of Knowledge, physicist Marcelo Gleiser traces our search for answers to the most fundamental questions of existence, the origin of the universe, the nature of reality, and the limits of knowledge. In so doing, he reaches a provocative conclusion: science, the main tool we use to find answers, is fundamentally limited. As science and its philosophical interpretations advance, we are often faced with the unsettling recognition of how much we don't know. Limits to our knowledge of the world arise both from our tools of exploration and from the nature of physical reality: the speed of light, the uncertainty principle, the second law of thermodynamics, the incompleteness theorem, and our own limitations as an intelligent species. Our view of physical reality depends fundamentally on who we are and on how we interact with the cosmos"--},

  abstract = {How did the human mind emerge from the collection of neurons that makes                 up the brain? How did the brain acquire self-awareness, functional autonomy,                 language, and the ability to think, to understand itself and the world? In this                 volume in the Essential Knowledge series, Zoltan Torey offers an accessible and                 concise description of the evolutionary breakthrough that created the human mind.                 Drawing on insights from evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and linguistics, Torey                 reconstructs the sequence of events by which Homo erectus became                 Homo sapiens. He describes the augmented functioning that                 underpins the emergent mind -- a new ("off-line") internal response system                 with which the brain accesses itself and then forms a selection mechanism for                 mentally generated behavior options. This functional breakthrough, Torey argues,                 explains how the animal brain's "awareness" became self-accessible and                 reflective -- that is, how the human brain acquired a conscious mind. Consciousness,                 unlike animal awareness, is not a unitary phenomenon but a composite process.                 Torey's account shows how protolanguage evolved into language, how a brain subsystem                 for the emergent mind was built, and why these developments are opaque to                 introspection. We experience the brain's functional autonomy, he argues, as free                 will. Torey proposes that once life began, consciousness had to emerge -- because                 consciousness is the informational source of the brain's behavioral response.                 Consciousness, he argues, is not a newly acquired "quality," "cosmic                 principle," "circuitry arrangement," or "epiphenomenon," as                 others have argued, but an indispensable working component of the living system's                 manner of functioning.},

  isbn = {978-0-19-513731-6},
  abstract = {This edited volume presents a comprehensive history of modern logic from the Middle Ages through the end of the twentieth century. In addition to a history of symbolic logic, the contributors also examine developments in the philosophy of logic and philosophical logic in modern times. The book begins with chapters on late medieval developments and logic and philosophy of logic from Humanism to Kant. The following chapters focus on the emergence of symbolic logic with special emphasis on the relations between logic and mathematics, on the one hand, and on logic and philosophy, on the other. This discussion is completed by a chapter on the themes of judgment and inference from 1837-1936. The volume contains a section on the development of mathematical logic from 1900-1935, followed by a section on main trends in mathematical logic after the 1930s. The volume goes on to discuss modal logic from Kant till the late twentieth century, and logic and semantics in the twentieth century; the philosophy of alternative logics; the philosophical aspects of inductive logic; the relations between logic and linguistics in the twentieth century; the relationship between logic and artificial intelligence; and ends  with a presentation of the main schools of Indian logic. The Development of Modern Logic includes many prominent philosophers from around the world who work in the philosophy and history of mathematics and logic, who not only survey developments in a given period or area but also seek to make new contributions to contemporary research in the field. It is the first volume to discuss the field with this breadth of coverage and depth, and will appeal to scholars and students of logic and its philosophy.},

  title = {Making {{Sense}} of {{Normative Functions}} and {{Information}} in {{Neurobiological Systems}}},
  url = {http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/5554},
  abstract = {In this thesis, I take up two important issues for understanding neurobiological systems: normative functions and information. After introducing the topic and my methodology in chapters 1 and 2, chapter 3 contains an extended critique of the most prominent theory of biological functions, the selected-effects theory of functions. My arguments center on the influential recent selected-effects theory arguing that it has trouble accounting for certain cases and does not seem to capture the sense of malfunction employed in the neurosciences. Chapter 4 defends an alternative theory of normative biological functions that I label the statistical fitness theory. Roughly, this theory holds that tokens of a trait type have the normative function to do something y if it is typical for tokens of that type of trait to y and their doing y contributes to the inclusive fitness of the organism that possesses the trait. In turn, this theory defines malfunctioning trait tokens as those whose effects that typically make positive contributions to fitness fall below the "normal" range in the population. Chapter 5 argues that several other recently popular theories of normative functions have significant flaws. $<$/p$>$$<$p$>$Chapter 6 takes up the issue of a certain kind of information, namely natural, propositional information. I provide a general framework that explains when signals carry this kind of information about their signifieds based upon stable, perfect correlations holding between the two. Hence, I label this the "stable correlation theory". I also argue that there are good reasons to think that neurons in our brains carry natural, propositional information and that their ability to do so is also grounded in stable correlations.},

Because many of these studies cut across disciplinary lines there is good reason to seek a clear consensus on what ‘sense of agency’ means. In this paper I indicate some complexities that this consensus might have to deal with. I also highlight an important phenomenological distinction that needs to be considered in any discussion of the sense of agency, regardless of how it gets defined. Finally, I suggest that the sense of agency has an ambiguous phenomenology and I offer some critical comments on current models that fail to notice this ambiguity.},

  shorttitle = {{{NonZero}}: The Logic of Human Destiny},
  abstract = {Review from H-Net Reviews Robert Wright. Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny. New York: Pantheon Books, 2000. x + 435 pp. Bibliography and index. \$27.50 (cloth), ISBN 0-679-44252-9. Reviewed by J. Bradford De Long, Department of Economics, University of California-Berkeley. Published by EH.Net (July, 2000) Back in 1794 the Enlightenment philosophe Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet wrote his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind -- the boldest of the eighteenth-century declarations that humanity had and was destined to see Progress with a capital P. Condorcet was a powerful and convincing advocate-- Malthus wrote his Essay on Population explicitly against Condorcet. But that was the high water mark of belief in Progress. By and large the past two centuries have seen the reaction, and confidence in human Progress -- technological, political, humanistic, and moral -- fell out of intellectual favor. Now comes Robert Wright, previously author of Three Scientists and Their Gods and The Moral Animal, with an excellent book accompanied by an enthusiastic blurb by William McNeill. Wright's purpose is to set out the gospel of progress anew, this time using the language of game theory as his principal mode of rhetoric. At its most basic level Wright's point is that interactions are positive-sum: there are gains from cooperation. Thus human cultural evolution has an arrow and a direction: toward greater complexity, toward higher civilization. The direction arises at two levels. First, individual humans seek out things that increase their own powers and capabilities. Cooperation tends to do this, so people find ways to cooperate. But the most important form of cooperation is one that is almost impossible to stop: the simple sharing of knowledge. Two heads are better than one. The denser the population (and the better the means of communication) the more ideas will be generated, the larger the number of ideas that turn out to be useful, and the faster will be progress. People are, Wright argues -- in my view correctly -- naturally acquisitive in that they want useful things, and will eagerly copy new technologies they hear about. Thus Wright sees inventions such as agriculture as inevitable -- not as a lucky accident. Second, at the level of human societies, the societies that are more powerful -- have better technologies, more effective social arrangements, greater population densities, and so forth -- either swamp their neighbors or force their neighbors to copy them in order to maintain their autonomy. In Eurasia, where contact was constant from an early age -- as Wright points out, in 200 on one could travel from Gibraltar to the Yangtze River and cross only three borders (p. 117) -- a good innovation at one end would diffuse all the way to the other in a matter of centuries. He believes that the wide spread of religion in agricultural civilizations proves that its productivity-boosting and division of labor-enhancing effects outweigh its exploitative side (p. 86): those societies that did not have temples and priests did not flourish. Wright dismisses gloomy talk of barbarian invasions and the fall of empires by asserting that one goes from furs-and-swords to linen-and-pens in three generations: 'The Romans weren't exactly hailed by the Greeks as cultural equals when they happened on the scene.... Yet they were massively infiltrated by classical Greek memes, which they then spread across the wider world. In Horace's phrase, 'The Greeks, captive, took the victors captive'. And, anyway, who were the Greeks to look down on intrusive barbarians? ... The early Greeks had a title of honor, ptoliporthos, that meant 'sacker of cities'.... But whether these 'barbarians' sack cities, or hover on the periphery and trade ... or ally with them in war or ally against them, one outcome is nearly certain: win, lose, or draw, the 'barbarians' become vehicles for advanced memes...' (p. 131). For what truly matters are the basic technologies of agriculture and craft, not the products of high civilizations. And even when you do have significant regression -- in the post-Mycenean Dark Age, in the post- Roman Dark Age, or in the wake of the Mongols - Wright reminds us that 'the world makes backup H-Net Reviews copies.' Wright also dismisses gloomy talk of the stagnation of Ming and Qing China, the fall of the Mughal Empire, and the technological and organizational stasis of the Ottoman Empire by arguing that the key unit is not Europe vs. Asia but is instead Eurasia. Sooner or later, Wright argues, some part of Eurasia -- it did not have to be Europe - would have hit upon a superior social and technological recipe to that of the mid second millennium empires, and when it did the rest would have copied it. Wright is of the school that holds that China almost broke through to modernity, writing of how paper and woodblock printing were used to distribute useful texts -- Pictures and Poems on Husbandry and Weaving, Mathematics for Daily Use, and the Treatise on Citrus Fruit (p. 159). The recipe that ultimately proved successful -- what Wright calls the economic logic of freedom -- was stopped in many places: 'indeed, on balance, in the centuries after the printing press was invented, European governments grew more despotic' (p. 185). But it only had to succeed once. And given sufficient cultural variation, sooner or later a breakthrough was inevitable. But even if you buy all of Wright's argument that forms of increasing returns -- non-zero-sumness, as Wright calls it -- impart an arrow of increasing complexity and division of labor to human social, cultural, and economic evolution, this does not necessarily amount to Progress -- at least not to anything we would see as progress in human morality or human happiness. For why should organizational complexity be Progress? As Wright puts it: '... it would be hard to argue that there was net moral gain between the huntergatherer and ancient-state phases of cultural evolution. The Egyptians had slaves -- which virtually no known hunter-gatherer societies had -- and their soldiers returned from wars of conquest proudly brandishing the severed penises of their slain foes' (p. 206). So in the end Wright is forced to play a game of three-card monte to reach conclusions that support his belief in Progress. The card labeled 'complexity' must be switched for the card labeled 'Progress' without our noticing. In the industrial core, at the end of the twentieth century, we are inclined to tolerate this switch -- to say that it is obvious that a highly complicated and productive civilization will have widely-distributed individual wealth, lots of individual freedom, and soft forms of rule, and that social complexity is civilization. But back in the middle of the twentieth century this switch could not have been accomplished at all: 'complexity yes,' people would have said, 'but progress no.' And who knows how things will look in a hundred more years? Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (1743-1794), was an aristocrat, a mathematician, an official of the Academy of Sciences, and was a friend of Voltaire (1694-1778). He strongly supported the revolution of 1789 as an example of human progress. But the Committee of Public Safety turned on him: he was arrested, and died in prison before he could be executed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *The above review covers only the first twothirds of the book. At that point Wright asks the question: 'Aren't organic evolution and human history sufficiently different to demand separate treatment?' I think the answer to this question is 'yes,' and that the book should stop at that point. Wright thinks that the answer is 'no,' and so the book continues. He goes on to draw analogies between human cultural evolution toward greater complexity and biological evolution toward greater complexity. Wright's argument that biological evolution has an arrow as well -- tends to produce animals with big brains that think -- runs roughly as follows: Life starts out simple. It then evolves, with variation and with the conservation and spread of successful variations. Thus evolution generates increasing diversity, and increasing diversity generates increasing complexity: it is hard for a one-celled organism to become less complicated (although viruses have managed), and easy for it to become more complicated. But wait! Most of your environment is made up of other living creatures. Hence the environment becomes more complicated over time too. And because the environment becomes more complicated over time, there is increasing adaptive value in information acquisition and information processing organs: better eyes (and ears) and bigger brains. Random evolution creates increasing diversity and complexity of life. Increasing diversity and complexity of life make for a more - 2 - H-Net Reviews complicated environment. And a more complicated environment generates strong evolutionary pressure for eyes, hands, and brains. Maybe his biological argument is right -- I'm inclined to think it probably is -- but maybe not. Big eyes and big brains are expensive in terms of energy. Why not go for bigger teeth or stronger legs? And large complicated animals seem to be (so far) at a disadvantage in species survival when the asteroids hit. Copyright (c) 2000 by H-Net, all rights reserved.

  shorttitle = {The {{Basic Problem}} of the {{Theory}} of {{Levels}} of {{Reality}}},
  abstract = {Verbatim extract from p.17 11. FORMS OF CAUSALITY I argued earlier that a level B may be causally constrained by an underlying level A but not categorially constrained by it. In other words, emergence is causally determined (if the necessary conditions are not in place, the emergent phenomenon does not occur), but once it has been constituted, the basic conditions remaining equal, the new level operates according to its own principles. The two basic oppositions can be summed up in the following hypotheses 1. Reduce everything to the lowest level. One can execute the reduction without any relevant loss of information because higher levels are purely epiphenomenal levels. 2. Reductions are not neutral because reality is intrinsically levelled. When you reduce, you cancel out aspects of reality. What really makes the difference between the above two theses is the further hypothesis that any ontologically different level has its own form of causality (or presents its own kind of phenomena, providing the term is properly understood). Verbatim excerpt from p.18 A theory of the levels thus becomes the natural setting for elaboration of a more articulated theory of the forms of causal dependence. Beside the usual kinds of basic causality between phenomena of the same nature, the theory of levels enables us to single out upward forms of causality (from the lower level to the upper one). But this is not all. A theory of levels also enables us to address the problem of downward forms of causality (from the upper to the lower level). The point is in direct contradiction of Hartmann, who always ruled out downward forms of causality. The question was examined by Donald Cambell some years ago (see e.g., 1974 and 1990), while the recent Andersen et al. (2000), to which the reader is referred for details, systematically collects a series of new studies on the theme.},

  abstract = {pp.15ff. Bottomore sees two sides to the concept of 'progress' in philosophy and history: The philosophical side referring to 'development' and also including the notion of 'civil society' as separate from 'political society' or the state; and the scientific conception of progress as the progression of historical periods and the coming into being of different types of society. q.v. Adam Ferguson, 1767, Essay on the History of Civil Society and cf. Ibn Khaldûn, 1958, Trans. Franz Rosenthal, An Introduction to History, Pantheon Books. Ferguson, writing in the eighteenth century, influenced Hegel with his theory of society as a system of interrelated social institutions, the notion of stages of development of human society and his classification of societies into specific types. In the nineteenth century Comte, Marx and Spencer used basically the same approach as Ferguson. The heritage of these theorists, deriving from the Enlightenment and the industrial and French revolutions led to the development of sociology as a 'science' of society. The consequences of this theoretical development were felt in society as a whole. For example, the problem of poverty was no longer seen as a natural aspect of human society, but as a social problem amenable to ameliorative measures. p.19 Nisbet describes sociology as '.. a reaction of traditionalism against analytical reason.' He sees the conservative or romantic tradition contributing the core concepts of 'community,' 'authority,' 'tradition' and 'the sacred.' [cf. Nisbet, Robert A., 1966, The Sociological Tradition, Basic Books, New York] The early sociology was encyclopaedic in scope, dealing with social life as a whole and with the whole of human history. Although the enterprise of sociology was modelled on the science of biology and the theory of evolution, the early therorists were preoccupied with problems of the industrial revolution. They brought to the nascent discipline a variety of contradictory ideological stances giving rise to rival theories and many of the disputes and controversies [which, in one form or another, continue to this day]. In the twentieth century sociology dealt with 'total social structures' although it no longer claimed to be encyclopaedic. [see quote from Hobhouse, p.21 of Bottomore. Note also quote from Durkheim promoting research 'with very limited subjects' so that General Sociology can then synthesise the results. 	- aims not achieved according to Bottomore. p.22 Durkheim argued that sociology must bring together knowledge from the 'history of law, customs and religion, social statistics, the economic sciences etc.....' Simmel, on the other hand, was eager to delimit the scope of sociology. p.23 Americanization of sociology. Note: Robert Lynd, 1939, Knowledge for What?, followed by C. Wright Mills, turning back to what he took to be structures of society. p.25 The basic directing idea of sociology is that of social structure which Bottomore defines as: the systematic interrelation of forms of behaviour or action in particular societies. p.26 Comparative method central.

  note = {pp.15ff. Bottomore s... pp.15ff. Bottomore sees two sides to the concept of 'progress' in philosophy and history: The philosophical side referring to 'development' and also including the notion of 'civil society' as separate from 'political society' or the state; and the scientific conception of progress as the progression of historical periods and the coming into being of different types of society. q.v. Adam Ferguson, 1767, Essay on the History of Civil Society and cf. Ibn Khaldûn, 1958, Trans. Franz Rosenthal, An Introduction to History, Pantheon Books. Ferguson, writing in the eighteenth century, influenced Hegel with his theory of society as a system of interrelated social institutions, the notion of stages of development of human society and his classification of societies into specific types. In the nineteenth century Comte, Marx and Spencer used basically the same approach as Ferguson. The heritage of these theorists, deriving from the Enlightenment and the industrial and French revolutions led to the development of sociology as a 'science' of society. The consequences of this theoretical development were felt in society as a whole. For example, the problem of poverty was no longer seen as a natural aspect of human society, but as a social problem amenable to ameliorative measures. p.19 Nisbet describes sociology as '.. a reaction of traditionalism against analytical reason.' He sees the conservative or romantic tradition contributing the core concepts of 'community,' 'authority,' 'tradition' and 'the sacred.' [cf. Nisbet, Robert A., 1966, The Sociological Tradition, Basic Books, New York] The early sociology was encyclopaedic in scope, dealing with social life as a whole and with the whole of human history. Although the enterprise of sociology was modelled on the science of biology and the theory of evolution, the early therorists were preoccupied with problems of the industrial revolution. They brought to the nascent discipline a variety of contradictory ideological stances giving rise to rival theories and many of the disputes and controversies [which, in one form or another, continue to this day]. In the twentieth century sociology dealt with 'total social structures' although it no longer claimed to be encyclopaedic. [see quote from Hobhouse, p.21 of Bottomore. Note also quote from Durkheim promoting research 'with very limited subjects' so that General Sociology can then synthesise the results. - aims not achieved according to Bottomore. p.22 Durkheim argued that sociology must bring together knowledge from the 'history of law, customs and religion, social statistics, the economic sciences etc.....' Simmel, on the other hand, was eager to delimit the scope of sociology. p.23 Americanization of sociology. Note: Robert Lynd, 1939, Knowledge for What?, followed by C. Wright Mills, turning back to what he took to be structures of society. p.25 The basic directing idea of sociology is that of social structure which Bottomore defines as: the systematic interrelation of forms of behaviour or action in particular societies. p.26 Comparative method central. Ch.2 The Question of Causal Explanation. pp.33-4 Marcuse condemns sociology because it 'eliminates man's freedom and rationality.'

  abstract = {Theory application -- Framing 101 -- Right wing power grab -- What's in a word? -- Metaphors of terror -- Metaphor and war, again -- Betrayal of trust : beyond lying -- From theory to action -- QA -- How to respond to conservatives p.39 Lakoff's progressive model of the nurturant family is somewhat disjointed and confused. It is based on: 1. a view of the way the world is (ie benign or good, not hostile) - this seems to ascribe human qualities to nature - suggesting a 'nurturant' mother nature. - It may be more common to progressive, and more coherent with an overall model, to see the world more in terms of the commons. It is like a farm that belongs to the 'family of man.' It needs careful tending but it is bountiful. p.40 2. Aview of human nature which is incomplete. - The notions of development and flourishing should be emphasised in relation to child-rearing and personal growth (cf Aristotle). - Note that there is an aspect of teleology or DESTINY within this fuller model. To make this concrete we need role-models (heroes). These could be generic (fireman) or particular: Martin Luther King Jr., John Kennedy Lakoff gives a rather 'straw person' view of the conservative model of the 'strict father' family. I'm sure there is a concept of partnership between husband and wife but with defined roles (improving security of 'self' for man, woman and children). Progressives probably need to be more convinced that their rationale for action has a sound reasoned basis (rather than the 'gut feeling' many neocons are likely to trust). Therefore, the family metaphor is not necessarily of the same genre as that used by neocons. It is more likely to include a theory of human nature which has some coherence. Compare Aristotle and Rousseau. Lakoff does not appear to address the problemematic notions that have been central to the progressive agenda. For example: The 'battle of the sexes' and 'the personal is political' have suggested that women need to battle against the men in their lives. This has been self-defeating and has helped to create a constituency for neocons. Compare Lakoff's insistence that people vote values rather than interests with Faux's emphais on the interests of workers. (Faux, 1996) It may be that many people do vote values rather than interests, much of the time. However, empirical evidence is needed before basing a whole strategy on this analysis.},

  abstract = {Cultural-historical activity theory is a new framework aimed at transcending the dichotomies of micro- and macro-, mental and material, observation and intervention in analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often difficult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, offer possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated `knotworking’ across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing different perspectives and conceptualizations. Findings from a longitudinal intervention study of children’s medical care illuminate the theoretical arguments.},

Both in academic research and policy circles, the concept of National Innovation Systems has represented a significant approach to industrial policy, research and development, and innovation. This book will review the development and implementation of this approach, and its strengths and weakness by considering the experience of Finland, widely regarded as a model of the information society, high-quality equal education, and systemic innovation policy amongst the Nordic welfare states, which themselves have increasingly topped the lists in national competitiveness. The first part of the book analyzes the foundations, emergence, and development of the National Innovation System approach and its adoption in Finnish science and technology policy throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In the second part of the book an alternative viewpoint to innovation and welfare policy is outlined, based on the idea of capability cultivating institutions as a key foundation, both for national welfare and competitiveness. The development of the Finnish comprehensive school and its special education system is studied in order to clarify the nature of institutional change and learning, and the conditions of governing and developing the enabling services. The concept of an enabling welfare state is developed to answer the challenges of the Nordic model of welfare in a globalizing knowledge-driven economy.},

  abstract = {Phoenicia (UK /fɨˈnɪʃə/ or US /fəˈniːʃə/; from the Greek: Φοινίκη, Phoiníkē; Arabic: فينيقية‎, Fīnīqīyah) was an ancient Semitic civilization situated on the western, coastal part of the Fertile Crescent and centered on the coastline of modern Lebanon. All major Phoenician cities were on the coastline of the Mediterranean, some colonies reaching the Western Mediterranean. It was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC. The Phoenicians used the galley, a man-powered sailing vessel, and are credited with the invention of the bireme. They were famed in Classical Greece and Rome as 'traders in purple', referring to their monopoly on the precious purple dye of the Murex snail, used, among other things, for royal clothing, and for their spread of their alphabets (or abjad), from which almost all modern phonetic alphabets are derived.
Phoenicians are widely thought to have originated from the earlier Canaanite inhabitants of the region. Although Egyptian seafaring expeditions had already been made to Byblos to bring back Lebanon Cedars as early as the 3rd millennium BC, continuous contact only occurred in the Egyptian New Empire period. In the Amarna tablets of the 14th century BC, people from the region called themselves Kenaani or Kinaani (either the same as the Canaanites, or the Kenanites/Cainanites spoken of the Septuagint version of Gen. 10:24), although these letters predate the invasion of the Sea Peoples by over a century. Much later, in the 6th century BC, Hecataeus of Miletus writes that Phoenicia was formerly called χνα (Latinized: khna), a name Philo of Byblos later adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: "Khna who was afterwards called Phoinix".
Phoenicia is really a Classical Greek term used to refer to the region of the major Canaanite port towns, and does not correspond exactly to a cultural identity that would have been recognised by the Phoenicians themselves. The term in Greek means 'land of purple', a reference to the valuable murex-shell dye they exported. It is uncertain to what extent the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single ethnicity and nationality. Their civilization was organized in city-states, similar to ancient Greece. However, in terms of archaeology, language, life style and religion, there is little to set the Phoenicians apart as markedly different from other Semitic cultures of Canaan. As Canaanites, they were unique in their remarkable seafaring achievements.
Each city-state was a politically independent unit. They could come into conflict and one city might be dominated by another city-state, although they would collaborate in leagues or alliances. Though ancient boundaries of such city-centered cultures fluctuated, the city of Tyre seems to have been the southernmost. Sarepta (modern day Sarafand) between Sidon and Tyre is the most thoroughly excavated city of the Phoenician homeland.
The Phoenicians were the first state-level society to make extensive use of alphabets. The Phoenician alphabet is generally believed to be the ancestor of almost all modern alphabets. From a traditional linguistic perspective, they spoke Phoenician, a Canaanite dialect. However, due to the very slight differences in language, and the insufficient records of the time, whether Phoenician formed a separate and united dialect, or was merely a superficially defined part of a broader language continuum, is unclear. Through their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to North Africa and Europe, where it was adopted by the Greeks, who later transmitted it to the Romans. In addition to their many inscriptions, the Phoenicians are believed to have left numerous other types of written sources, but most have not survived.},

  abstract = {The Phoenician alphabet, called by convention the Proto-Canaanite alphabet for inscriptions older than around 1200 BC, is the oldest verified consonantal alphabet, or abjad. It was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language, used by the civilization of Phoenicia. It is classified as an abjad because it records only consonantal sounds (matres lectionis were used for some vowels in certain late varieties).
The Phoenician alphabet is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics  and became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was directly derived from Phoenician. The Aramaic alphabet, a modified form of Phoenician, was the ancestor of modern Arabic script. The Modern Hebrew script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic script. The Greek alphabet (and by extension its descendants such as the Latin, the Cyrillic, and the Coptic) was a direct successor of Phoenician, and the first full alphabet (including vowels, rather than just consonants), having evolved certain letter values to represent vowels.
As the letters were originally incised with a stylus, most of the shapes are angular and straight, although more cursive versions are increasingly attested in later times, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet of Roman-era North Africa. Phoenician was usually written from right to left, although there are some texts written in boustrophedon.
In 2005, UNESCO registered the Phoenician alphabet into the Memory of the World Programme as a heritage of Lebanon.},

  abstract = {The Greek alphabet is the script that has been used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BC. It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. As such, it became the ancestor of numerous other European and Middle Eastern alphabets, including Latin and Cyrillic. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, both in its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.
In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era.
Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, owing to phonological changes in the language.
In traditional ("polytonic") Greek orthography, vowel letters can be combined with several diacritics, including accent marks, so-called "breathing" marks, and the iota subscript. In common present-day usage for Modern Greek since the 1980s, this system has been simplified to a so-called "monotonic" convention.},

  abstract = {A writing system is an organized, regular method (typically standardized) of information storage and transfer for the communication of messages (expressing thoughts or ideas) in a language by visually (or possibly tactilely) encoding and decoding (known as writing and reading) with a set of signs or symbols, both known generally as characters (with the set collectively referred to as a 'script'). These characters, often including letters and numbers, are usually recorded onto a durable medium such as paper or electronic storage/display, although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing in sand or skywriting.
The general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as alphabets, syllabaries, or logographies. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) of consonants and vowels that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. A syllabary typically correlates a symbol to a syllable (which can be a pairing or group of phonemes, and are considered the building blocks of words). In a logography, each character represents a word, morpheme or semantic unit (which themselves can be pairings or groups of syllables). Other categories include abjads (which is an alphabet where vowels are not indicated at all) and abugidas, also called alphasyllabaries (where vowels are shown by diacritics or other modification of consonants). A system's category can often be determined just by identifying the number of symbols used within the system. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100, and logographies can have several hundreds of symbols.
Most systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like words or acronyms (generally lexemes), giving rise to many more possibilities (permutations) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the concatenation (a "stringing together") of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full expression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished by the reader purely in the mind as an internal process, or expressed verbally (typically, 'reading aloud'). Historically, writing systems have developed after a spoken language has been established, although the individual symbols used (typically an ideogram) may have preceded the spoken word. A special set of symbols known as punctuation is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing systems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's meaning that are communicated verbally by cues in timing, tone, accent, inflection or intonation.
A writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded messages that follows the spoken version's rules like its grammar and syntax so that the reader will have the meaning of the intended message accurately preserved. Writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other mnemonic symbols. Proto-writing lacked the ability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BCE, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of error to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, it provided a reliable form of long distance communication. And with the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication. Secure written communications were also made more reliable with the invention of encryption.},

  abstract = {The Vedas (/ˈveɪdəz, ˈviː-/; Sanskrit: वेद véda, "knowledge") are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauruṣeya, which means "not of a man, superhuman" and "impersonal, authorless".
Vedas are also called śruti ("what is heard") literature, distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smṛti ("what is remembered"). The Veda, for orthodox Indian theologians, are considered as revelations, some way or other the work of the Deity. In the Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma.
There are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), the Brahmanas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and the Upanishads (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add fifth category – the Upasanas (worship).
The various Indian philosophies and denominations have taken differing positions on the Vedas. Schools of Indian philosophy which cite the Vedas as their scriptural authority are classified as "orthodox" (āstika). Other Sramana traditions, such as Lokayata, Carvaka, Ajivika, Buddhism and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authorities are referred to as "heterodox" or "non-orthodox" (nāstika) schools. Despite their differences, just like Sramana traditions, various Hindu traditions dwell on, express and teach similar ideas such as karma (retributive action) and moksha (liberation) in the fourth layer of the Vedas – the Upanishads.},

  abstract = {The Renaissance (UK /rɨˈneɪsəns/, US /ˈrɛnɨsɑːns/) is a period from the 14th to the 17th century, considered the bridge between the Middle Ages and Modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe. Some good early examples were the perspective within painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe.
As a cultural movement, it encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and, gradual but widespread educational reform.
In politics, the Renaissance contributed the development of the conventions of diplomacy, and in science an increased reliance on observation. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance man".
There is a consensus that the Renaissance began in Florence, Italy, in the 14th century. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time; its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici; and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. Other major centres were northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Milan and finally Rome during the Renaissance Papacy.
The Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual culture heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of "Renaissance": It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art. Some have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras which are linked, as Panofsky himself observed, "by a thousand ties".
The word Renaissance, literally meaning "Rebirth" in French, first appears in English in the 1830s. The word occurs in Jules Michelet's 1855 work, Histoire de France. The word Renaissance has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century.},

The term Renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt. Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century. The French word renaissance (Rinascimento in Italian) means "rebirth", and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labeled the Dark Ages. These changes, while significant, were concentrated in the elite, and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages.},

  abstract = {The Case for the Enlightenment is a comparative study of the emergence of Enlightenment in Scotland and in Naples. Challenging the tendency to fragment the Enlightenment in eighteenth-century Europe into multiple Enlightenments, the distinguished intellectual historian John Robertson demonstrates the extent to which thinkers in two societies at the opposite ends of Europe shared common intellectual preoccupations. Before 1700, Scotland and Naples faced a bleak future as backward, provincial kingdoms in a Europe of aggressive commercial states. Yet by 1760, Scottish and Neapolitan thinkers were in the van of those advocating the cause of Enlightenment by means of political economy. By studying the social and institutional contexts of intellectual life in the two countries, and the currents of thought promoted within them, The Case for the Enlightenment explains this transformation. John Robertson pays particular attention to the greatest thinkers in each country, David Hume and Giambattista Vico.},

The creation of the term can be traced back to the writings of thirteenth-century mystics. The original religious connotation remained important, and was partly handed down in Pietistic writings, but the word was put into other contexts, for example ethics, aesthetics and cognition. In the eighteenth century the concept was filled with the philosophical trends of Baroque and German Idealism. The names of Herder, Humboldt, Goethe and Schiller represent the Bildungsidee in its heyday. Selbstbildung (self-education) was an essential element of the Bildungsidee that in principle belongs to the area of adult education.
The concept had a lasting influence. In the 1960s and 1970s the Bildungsidee was subject to a critical debate in Germany. The idea of Selbstbildung, formulated by Humboldt, seemed at the same time attractive, because of its aspects of emancipation, and unacceptable, because of its élitist implications. Important arguments of the debate will be introduced and followed by the question: is it anachronistic to discuss the Bildungsidee today, instead of merely concentrating on the concept of ‘learning’ as the main paradigm of adult education?},

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {Governance failures are at the origin of many resource management problems. In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific.
First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice.},

Association in decision is necessary (although insufficient) for happiness in the sense of eudaimonia.

contemporary crisis of modernity to the crisis of the Welfare State in
the West and to its so far incomplete establishment in 'Latin'-America,

thus linked to a discussion of citizenship and social police which
harks back to the definition of the principles of social policy,
focusing on the possible alternative of 'generative politics' as a
means of creating new forms of collective solidarity. The crisis of
dialectical thought and the problem of social change are thereby
tackled and a different way of understanding them is put forward, in
accordance with new sorts of contemporary sociability.},

Starting with a discussion of the long standing debate between determinism and agency, we argue that the seeds of a reconciliation can be found in George Herbert Mead’s ideas concerning social acts, perspectives, differentiation, self-other interactivity, and conscious understanding. Drawing on more recent reformulations of Mead’s ideas, we present an integrated account of the ontogenesis of human agency. Human agency, we argue, should be conceptualized in terms of distanciation from immediate experience, and we show how social interactions, institutions and symbolic resources foster the development of agency in increasingly complex ways. We conclude by situating our work in relation to other developmental accounts and the larger project of theorizing and empirically supporting a compatibilist rendering of human agency as the “determined” self-determination of persons.},

In Romanticism Against the Tide of Modernity Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre formulate a theory that defines romanticism as a cultural protest against modern bourgeois industrial civilization and work to reveal the unity that underlies the extraordinary diversity of romanticism from the eighteenth to the twenty-first century.  After critiquing previous conceptions of romanticism and discussing its first European manifestations, Löwy and Sayre propose a typology of the sociopolitical positions held by romantic writers-from “restitutionist” to various revolutionary/utopian forms. In subsequent chapters, they give extended treatment to writers as diverse as Coleridge and Ruskin, Charles Peguy, Ernst Bloch and Christa Wolf. Among other topics, they discuss the complex relationship between Marxism and romanticism before closing with a reflection on more contemporary manifestations of romanticism (for example, surrealism, the events of May 1968, and the ecological movement) as well as its future. Students and scholars of literature, humanities, social sciences, and cultural studies will be interested in this elegant and thoroughly original book.},

  abstract = {This essay first describes some of the impressive theoretical and empirical contributions of The Sociology of Philosophies, namely, to cultural sociology. Second, it offers a criticism of Collins's argument by focusing on the conceptions of the self it posits; its lack of specificity concerning the relationship between intellectual networks and imagined communities of scholars; and its neglect of how the law of small numbers is affected by the size of a field. Against a priori definitions of the selves of intellectuals posited by Collins, I advocate approaching the diversity of their selves as an empirical issue. Against Collins's overemphasis on personal network centrality in the making of philosophical greatness, I propose that the transcendent values of intellectual work are insufficient but nonetheless necessary conditions for philosophical greatness.},

It does so selectively, identifying three stages in which this relationship is developed: (1) from the Homeric to archaic eras; (2) fifth-century Athenian democracy, in which and are posed as complementary terms; and (3) the fourth century era in which philosophers used virtue to critique democracy. Relying mostly on evidence from writers who have become benchmarks in the history of Western political thought, the argument emphasizes the inherently political dimension of during this period of ancient Greek culture. Noting different ways in which is related to political power in general and democracy in particular, it also illustrates the manner in which is neither philosophically pristine nor merely an instrument of practical power. The effect of the research contradicts traditional and recent readings of democracy and virtue as inherently antagonistic. The aim of the article is to identify ancient Greek contributions to understanding the potential, contingencies and dangers of the relationship between democracy (as a form of power) and virtue (as a form of ethics) — one which may benefit both democracy and virtue.},

This calculus of power relations within and between polities aids understanding of how power shifts occur and under what conditions various power distributions constitute stable and unstable configurations. Power relations, while predicated on systems of values, leave physical evidence when their importance is ranked and reranked by individuals, groups, and organizations as conditions change. The hierar- chy-heterarchy relation offers a new approach to the study of agency, conflict, and cooperation.},

  abstract = {The education revolution is profoundly transforming postindustrial culture, creating new types of knowledge and experts; new definitions of personal success and failure, intelligence, and human talent; a new workplace and conception of jobs; and new styles of parenting, political mobilization, and reach of mass religion. At the same time, educational achievement, degree attainment, and credentials have come to dominate social stratification and social mobility, superseding and delegitimizing all noneducational forms of status attainment. Four decades of sociological research points to a future society where education performance will be the singular dominant factor in social status attainment, and education will be one of the most transforming of social institutions for individuals and other social institutions. In fact, to a large extent this has already happened and an advanced version of the schooled society is evident in a number of nations. The prediction offered here is that the stage now is set for an intensification of both phenomena into the future. Thus, a full understanding of the consequences of the education revolution for postindustrial society is a major frontier facing the sociological investigation of education.},

We offer a theoretical interpretation of mass state-sponsored schooling that emphasizes the role of education in the nation-building efforts of states competing with one another within the European interstate system. We show that political, economic, and cultural developments in Europe led to a model of the legitimate national society that became highly institutionalized in the European (and later, world) cultural frame. This model made the construction of a mass educational system a major and indispensable component of every modern state's activity. We discuss the usefulness of this perspective for understanding recent cross-national studies of education.},

Distressingly, the sociological literature on the concept rarely addresses relevant social psychological research. We take a social behaviorist approach to agency by suggesting that individual temporal orientations are underutilized in conceptualizing this core sociological concept. Different temporal foci--the actor's engaged response to situational circumstances--implicate different forms of agency. This article offers a theoretical model involving four analytical types of agency ("existential," "identity," "pragmatic," and "life course") that are often conflated across treatments of the topic. Each mode of agency overlaps with established social psychological literatures, most notably about the self, enabling scholars to anchor overly abstract treatments of agency within established research literatures.},

Archer has dubbed “central conflation”: an antidualistic position appreciating the interdependency of agency and structure, individuals and society. This has been a popular outlook in recent years, advocated broadly by such theorists as Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Collins, and Anthony Giddens. However, antidualism has been challenged by those who believe the key to success in social science lies in level-ontological emergentism. Archer’s own morphogenetic theory is an explicitly dualist version of that approach. I answer Archer’s arguments for emergentism, in so doing clearing a path for the even fuller acceptance of antidualism by theorists.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the current trend towards online education. It examines some of the reasons for the trend and the ramifications it may have on students, faculty and institutions of higher learning. The success and profitability of online programs and institutions such as the University of Phoenix has helped to make the move towards online education more appealing to other institutions, as well as, helped to change how online education is viewed by the public. Reasons such as cost, accessibility and flexibility are often presented as motivations for why many students and institutions use online learning. However, the reasons behind the movement towards more online learning may be more motivated by capitalistic ideals associated with an ever increasingly knowledge-based economy than that of providing quality and more accessible education. The movement towards more online learning coupled with the increased corporatization of higher education may be helping to contribute to the commodification of knowledge and the changing role of institutions and education itself. Thus potentially leading to a state in which education is further transformed into a commodity, students becoming more like consumers, faculty into entrepreneurs, and institutions of higher learning into storefronts for knowledge.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Indeed, as Gelernter explains, when we are at our most alert, when reasoning and creating new memories is our main mental business, the mind is a computer-like machine that keeps emotion on a short leash and attention on our surroundings. As we gradually tire, however, and descend the 'mental spectrum,' reasoning comes unglued. Memory ranges more freely, the mind wanders, and daydreams grow more insistent. Self-awareness fades, reflection blinks out, and at last we are completely immersed in our own minds"--Dust jacket flap.},

These two young geniuses and the three women vital to their work—actresses Lotte Lenya and Helene Weigel and writer Elizabeth Hauptmann—joined talents to create the theatrical and musical masterworks The Threepenny Opera and The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, only to split in rancor as their culture cracked open and their aesthetic and temperamental differences became irreconcilable.
"The first book to tell the full story of Brecht and Weill's impulsive, combustible partnership, the compelling psychological drama of one of the most important creative collaborations of the past century. It is also the first book to give full credit where it is richly due to the three women--[actresses Lotte Lenya and Helene Weigel and writer Elizabeth Hauptmann]--whose creative gifts contributed enormously to their masterworks. And it tells the thrilling and iconic story of artistic daring entwined with sexual freedom during the Weimar Republic's most fevered years, a time when art and politics and society were inextricably mixed"--Amazon.com.

Late twentieth century philosophical insight provides an understanding of Consciousness, the World and meaning. Post-modernism adds a framework for grasping language, narrative, microtheatres of power and the controlling effects of such cultural systems. A critique of prevailing notions of our identity breaks open the master narrative that informs our present world. Chapters about modern science, traditional religious and spiritual discourse, the arts and the stars highlight alternative narrative threads. Finally, possibilities and tools suggested by Complexity Theory inform a plan of action.

Handbook for a Phase Transition is an invitation. A guide for completely transforming our world from what we have to what all of us would wish to create.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews recent work on knowledge acquisition with a focus on knowledge restructuring. This work suggests that it may be possible to replace Piagetian theories of global restructuring with a more domain-specific approach. Some forms of learning may give rise to a weak restructuring involving the accumulation of new facts and the formation of new relations between existing concepts. Other forms of learning may involve a radical restructuring that includes a change in core concepts, a change in structure, and a change in the phenomena to be explained. The restructuring view raises important questions about the similarities and differences in the child's and the scientist's acquisition of knowledge, and about the role of prior knowledge in instruction. The domain of observational astronomy is used as an example of how these issues can be applied to study the child's development of knowledge. Several mechanisms for knowledge restructuring are discussed and it is argued that these issues are crucial for a theory-based approach to the study of instruction.},

Even 3-year-olds could assess their epistemic states in the total ignorance and the complete knowledge task. However, only children older than 5 could assess their ignorance in the partial exposure task. In Experiment 2 with one hundred and one 3- to 7-year-olds, similar results were found for children under 5 years even when more objects were shown in partial exposure tasks.

In this book,  the author, a  psychiatrist busts a number of commonly held myths about adolescence. He shows that, if parents and teens can work together to form a deeper understanding of the brain science behind all the tumult, they will be able to turn conflict into connection and form a deeper understanding of one another. According to the author, during adolescence we learn important skills, such as how to leave home and enter the larger world, how to connect deeply with others, and how to safely experiment and take risks, thereby creating strategies for dealing with the world's increasingly complex problems. Here he presents an inside-out approach to focusing on how brain development affects our behavior and relationships. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, he explores exciting ways in which understanding how the brain functions can improve the lives of adolescents, making their relationships more fulfilling and less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.},

Pedagogy, Symbolic Control and Identity addresses the central issue of Bernstein s research project: are there any general principles underlying the transformation of knowledge into pedagogic communication? In Bernstein s view, we have studied only pedagogic messages and their institutional and ideological base. We have not studied the nature of the relay which makes messages possible. The discussion of this research forms part II of this book, where Bernstein makes explicit the methodology of the research and, in particular, the crucial significance of languages of description. This new edition of Bernstein's classic book is updated with three new chapters: on discourse, on official knowledge and identities, and a wide ranging interview with Joseph Solomon. The new edition, published as Volume Five in his Class, Codes, and Control Series, builds on the continuing tradition of Bernstein's highly influential work on class, education, language, and society."},

The present vol ume is the first of this series to appear in English but it is actually Volume 2 in the Russian series. It contains a complete rendition of Thinking and Speech (which may be known to English readers as Thought and Language, the title assigned to an abridged, interpretative translation by Hanfmann and Vakar in 1962) and five Lectures in Psy chology which are here published for the first time in English and essentialIy comprise Vygotsky's systematization of psychological theory and data in respect to the develop ment in childhood of perception, memory, thinking, emotions, imagination, and will. The volumes which are yet to appear in English are respectively concerned with: (1) theory and history of psychology; (2) problems of developmental psychology; (3) child and adolescent psychology; (4) "defectology" (or "special education" in American par lance); and (5) a "scientific archive" consisting of a critique of Spinoza's studies of the passions and an important essay, "Tool and Sign. " The decision by the Translator and Editors to render the title of the first segment of this volume, Mysclzlenie i Rech', as Thinking and Speech and not as Thought and Language, as it was previously translated, was a very intentional one.},

  abstract = {By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis -- from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid "thesis neurosis" and he answers the important question "Must You Read Books?" He reminds students "You are not Proust" and "Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft." Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: Strunk and White and The Name of the Rose.This MIT Press edition will be available in three different cover colors.ContentsThe Definition and Purpose of a ThesisChoosing the TopicConducting ResearchThe Work Plan and the Index CardsWriting the ThesisThe Final Draft},

Oshana develops a 'social relational' account of autonomy, or self-governance, as a condition of persons that is largely constituted by a person's relations with other people and by the absence of certain social relations. She denies that command over one's motives and the freedom to realize one's will are sufficient to secure the kind of command over one's life that autonomy requires, and argues against psychological, procedural, and content neutral accounts of autonomy."--BOOK JACKET.},

An alternative position is advocated, one which takes into account a relationship between the knower and the known. Some of the implications of such a co-constructivist position for family therapy are outlined.},

  abstract = {Anti-essentialism has criticised a range of targets, from cultural essentialism and biological reductionism to causal explanation and foundationalism, and concerning topics ranging from markets to ‘race’, identity and sexuality. The paper assesses these diverse lines of critique. Some social phenomena, like identities, clearly do not have essences, but it does not follow from this that other phenomena we study do not have essences or something like them. While a strong, or deterministic essentialism is always wrong and often dangerously misleading, a moderate, non-deterministic essentialism is necessary for explanation and for a social science that claims to be critical and have emancipatory potential. The concept of essence is problematic, but not for some of the epistemological and ontological reasons put forward by anti-essentialism. Strong variants of social constructionism are liable to invert rather than resolve the problems of strong essentialism, including those of its biological reductionist guises. While it may be best to avoid concepts of essences which assume that the distinguishing and generative properties of objects must coincide, we still need to distinguish classes of objects and identify causal powers which enable and constrain what those objects can do.},

Approaches to Social Enquiry draws together a vast body of literature from the philosophy of science, the philosophy of social science, social theory and research methodology.    It focuses on questions such as: How is new social scientific knowledge produced or existing knowledge further developed? What status does this knowledge have and how can this be established? To what extent can the ways of advancing knowledge in the natural sciences be used in the social sciences? What major dilemmas do social researchers face in the development of new knowledge? No other text offers such a clear and accessible, but still rigorous, account of these sometimes complex debates.  This second edition has been thoroughly updated to encompass the most contemporary debates about the conduct and underpinnings of social research. More attention is also paid to research practice. In addition, integrated empirical examples have been included to illustrate and extend the philosophical and theoretical discussion.  Approaches to Social Enquiry will be invaluable to advanced undergraduate and graduate students who are planning their own research or studying research methods, and to researchers across a wide range of disciplines.},

  abstract = {With the unusual clarity, distinctive and engaging style, and penetrating insight that have drawn such a wide range of readers to his work, Ian Hacking here offers his reflections on the philosophical uses of history. The focus of this volume, which collects both recent and now-classic essays, is the historical emergence of concepts and objects, through new uses of words and sentences in specific settings, and new patterns or styles of reasoning within those sentences. In its lucid and thoroughgoing look at the historical dimension of concepts, the book is at once a systematic formulation of Hacking's approach and its relation to other types of intellectual history, and a valuable contribution to philosophical understanding.Hacking opens the volume with an extended meditation on the philosophical significance of history. The importance of Michel Foucault--for the development of this theme, and for Hacking's own work in intellectual history--emerges in the following chapters, which place Hacking's classic essays on Foucault within the wider context of general reflections on historical methodology. Against this background, Hacking then develops ideas about how language, styles of reasoning, and "psychological" phenomena figure in the articulation of concepts--and in the very prospect of doing philosophy as historical ontology.},

  abstract = {The philosophy of the classical American pragmatism represents one of the basic challenges to the conception of self and reason in the history of philosophical and psychological thinking. As the founder of pragmatism, Peirce is well known for his attempt to overcome the Cartesian tradition of philosophy, which was founded on the paradigm of monologic self-consciousness and self-awareness. The dialogical principle is a core piece of the Peircean semiotics, which has deep implications to subjectivity, meaning-construction, reasoning on the "self," and communication. The reinterpretation of the classic tradition of thinking on signs leads Peirce to a triadic and dynamic-dialogical conception of signs. For Peirce, a sign is as such because it stands for something to somebody. It creates in the mind of the person an equivalent or a more developed sign. This radical conception of semiotics terminated in the idea of "man as a sign" and the claim that "men and words reciprocally educate each other." The self is an interpreting subject and an interpreted object. In its innermost being, the self is a communicative agent. The epistemological consequence of this conception is as follows: Truth is closely related to intersubjectivity and the private is synonymous with erroneous.},

  abstract = {Seeking a rapprochement between Vygotskians and Piagetians, the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky are compared, and educational extensions by their followers are examined. A paradox in Vygotsky's theory is highlighted, where evidence is found both for claiming that Vygotsky was a behaviorist and that he was a constructivist. Similarities in the two theories are presented: social factors as having a central role in child development, the transformative nature of internalization, and the individual as what develops. Differences in the theories pertain to the nature of the stimulus, nature and origin of psychological instruments, nature of self-regulation and novelty in development, direction of development, the concept of social development, and the role of language in development. Because practical applications of theories often clarify the theories, some educational extensions of Vygotsky's theory are critiqued from a Piagetian constructivist perspective, and, in contrast, constructivist educational interpretations of Vygotsky's work are noted. Aspects of Piaget's theory emphasized by educators are presented, and educational practices inspired by this theory are outlined. A rapprochement is sought, with consideration of convergences in educational practices of followers of Piaget and Vygotsky, sources of difficulty for rapprochement, and changes necessary in educational theories of followers of both Piaget and Vygotsky.},

Their two prominent spearheads, Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, soon understood that their scientific endeavors depended on deciphering the mechanisms which, in each case, generated these distorted reflections. These mechanisms were class division—the complex network that in any given social milieu consolidates around specific relations of production—and the splitting up of the psychic apparatus into conscious and unconscious regions, with repression acting as a wall between them. From these two divided structures, social and psychic superficial mirages ensued: on the one hand, ideological and fetishistic representations of society, which did no justice to the multiple social strata; on the other, introspective images of the psychic apparatus, the distorted nature of which resulted from the fact that they emerged from the conscious layers of psychic life (from the ego), and left out the unconscious regions.},

  abstract = {Perceptions may be compared with hypotheses in science. The methods of acquiring scientific knowledge provide a working paradigm for investigating processes of perception. Much as the information channels of instruments, such as radio telescopes, transmit signals which are processed according to various assumptions to give useful data, so neural signals are processed to give data for perception. To understand perception, the signal codes and the stored knowledge or assumptions used for deriving perceptual hypotheses must be discovered. Systematic perceptual errors are important clues for appreciating signal channel limitations, and for discovering hypothesis-generating procedures. Although this distinction between 'physiological' and 'cognitive' aspects of perception may be logically clear, it is in practice surprisingly difficult to establish which are responsible even for clearly established phenomena such as the classical distortion illusions. Experimental results are presented, aimed at distinguishing between and discovering what happens when there is mismatch with the neural signal channel, and when neural signals are processed inappropriately for the current situation. This leads us to make some distinctions between perceptual and scientific hypotheses, which raise in a new form the problem: What are 'objects'?},

  abstract = {Niche construction theory is a relatively new approach in evolutionary biology that seeks to integrate an ecological dimension into the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection. It is regarded by many evolutionary biologists as providing a significant revision of the Neo-Darwinian modern synthesis that unified Darwin’s theory of natural and sexual selection with 20th century population genetics. Niche construction theory has been invoked as a processual mediator of social cognitive evolution and of the emergence and evolution of language. I argue that language itself can be considered as a biocultural niche and evolutionary artifact. I provide both a general analysis of the cognitive and semiotic status of artifacts, and a formal analysis of language as a social and semiotic institution, based upon a distinction between the fundamental semiotic relations of “counting as” and “standing for.” I explore the consequences for theories of language and language learning of viewing language as a biocultural niche. I suggest that not only do niches mediate organism-organism interactions, but also that organisms mediate niche-niche interactions in ways that affect evolutionary processes, with the evolution of human infancy and childhood as a key example. I argue that language as a social and semiotic system is not only grounded in embodied engagements with the material and social-interactional world, but also grounds a sub-class of artifacts of particular significance in the cultural history of human cognition. Symbolic cognitive artifacts materially and semiotically mediate human cognition, and are not merely informational repositories, but co-agentively constitutive of culturally and historically emergent cognitive domains. I provide examples of the constitutive cognitive role of symbolic cognitive artifacts drawn from my research with my colleagues on cultural and linguistic conceptualizations of time, and their cultural variability. I conclude by reflecting on the philosophical and social implications of understanding artifacts co-agentively.},

  abstract = {Understanding relations between the social and cognitive contributions to thinking and acting has become a pressing goal for psychological theorizing. Central to understanding these relations is the negotiation and construction of knowledge that is comprised of the inter-psychological processes that engage both cognitive and social experiences. This paper proposes that these processes can be understood through a complex of relations among different sociogenetic sources and between those sources and individuals’ agency as constituted by their life histories or ontogenies. Rather than a single sociogenetic source, the social contributions are held to have historical-cultural and situational geneses. However, through inter-psychological processes these contributions are mediated by individuals’ unique and socially shaped cognitive experiences. Findings from an investigation of the same vocational practice (hairdressing) conducted in four different work settings are used to identify tentative relations between the sociogeneses of the goal-directed activities that individuals engage in, and how these individuals represent their knowledge in memory. Together, these findings tentatively elaborate particular sociogenetic contributions to individuals’ thinking and acting, and relations between particular elements and phases of goal-directed activities and, hence, their impact on cognitive change (development).},

  abstract = {In this commentary I focus initially on the shared critical perspective of de Lemos (2000) and Nelson (2000) upon developmental psychology’s construction of the developing subject. I suggest that the plurality of temporalities which underpin the human self and human culture is reduced, in most theories of development, to a unitary and deterministic ‘chronotype’ of pure, universal sequence. As against the dominant approach in developmental psychology, which views the subject as a ‘Mind/Brain’ analysing ‘input data’ with respect to an innately constrained ‘hypothesis-space’, de Lemos and Nelson view the developing subject as an embodied and interested participant, in an intersubjectively and communicatively constituted arena of interpretation. While sharing this general perspective with de Lemos and Nelson, I draw attention to the differences between their theoretical formulations, and suggest that both of them lack a certain level of analytic specificity, especially with respect to analysing language itself. I propose that a serious theoretical and methodological encounter between socio-cultural approaches to human development and cognitive and cultural linguistics needs to be put on the agenda. I conclude with a brief discussion of the papers on phylogeny, and offer a schematic rendering of the difference between ‘traditional’ and ‘alternative’ views of the dependency relations between sociogenesis, ontogenesis and phylogenesis.},

Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life.},

  abstract = {The autobiographical writings of the sometime Canadian resident Ilona Duczynska (1897-1978), born near Vienna of a Polish father and Hungarian mother (both of the lower nobility), were designed to show how experiences within the family during childhood and youth led to her becoming a revolutionary. Duczynska claimed to have experienced a species of class struggle-involving the families of her idealized father and her much criticized mother-that brought about the death of the former and marked her personally with the sign of inferiority. It followed, then, that education was powerless to amend what Duczynska decided she had already 'learned' within the family, including her malcontent father's characteristic spirit of negation. Consequently, Duczynska describes the various stages of her distinctly privileged education in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Hungary-almost entirely in terms of how she availed herself of opportunities to take a 'stand' against existing institutions. Inevitably, in 1922 even the 'party school' of the Hungarian Communist Party forfeited her confidence. Further research, drawing on psychological insights, may show why Duczynska's family experiences should have led to a mistrust of the family as an institution, fascination with 'revolutionary violence', and life-long hatred of liberal democratic (and capitalist) institutions.

  abstract = {At the age of twenty, Ilona Duczynska became Hungary's leading female revolutionary: first organizing anti-war propaganda in 1917, then - as a member of the newly formed Hungarian Communist Party - working for the next four years in the 1919 Budapest Republic of Soviets and, in 1920, briefly in Moscow, before being expelled from the Party in 1922. Later she assisted in the final phase of the anti-fascist stand of the Austrian Workers Militia (Schutzbund) in Vienna from 1934-36. The 1956 Hungarian revolution made a great impact on her, and thereafter she dedicated herself to assisting and working with the "dissident" intellectual opposition in Budapest - from her home in Canada and a flat in Vienna - in an attempt to transform bureaucratic state communism into something resembling "socialism with a human face." Late in life she began work on an autobiography; however, only the first chapter, tracing her development up to the age of twenty, was published. Taken together with other articles of hers, published and unpublished, the autobiography seeks to explain her emerging revolutionary consciousness in terms of nascent "class struggle" within the family. Against a detailed descriptive background, Duczynska claims to show how her parents and their socially very different families represented what she summarily judged to be socially positive and negative. Most memorably and perhaps curiously, the idealized portrait of her Austrian father - an impoverished would-be inventor of flying machines, self-taught intellectual, and atheist of radical inclinations - is juxtaposed to her tendentiously negative portrayal of a mother who was of Hungarian gentry background. Childhood experiences, then, first set Duczynska on what she calls "the path" to political activism. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

By reference to former youth studies an argumentation is developed that relates the issues of actual political dissent within the country to the discrepant historical experiences of different age cohorts. Following the parliamentary report Youth Protest in the Democratic State (1983), the political taboo of the German present (Nato) is interpreted in the light of the political taboo of the German past (Nazism).},

Alternatively, the article argues that a focus on embodiment is key to articulating the political potential of mindfulness. An emphasis on mindful embodiment, both in theory and in practice, can issue a challenge to the latent mind–body dualism of much of the theoretical discourse on mindfulness and highlights the capacities of relationality, empathy, and attunement, capacities which are the foundation of the political significance of mindfulness. Practices of mindful embodiment provide a counterpoint to the focus upon contemplation in the mindfulness literature and help to refute the concern that mindfulness practice is solipsistic and apolitical. The article concludes by exploring the Occupy Wall Street movement as illustrative of the significance of mindful embodiment to contemporary social movements.},

  abstract = {This article explores the growing use of mind/body practices such as meditation and yoga in Left social movements. The analysis is rooted in interviews with activists participating in the transformative movement-building current: the growing number of organizations integrating subjective and social transformation practices. William Connolly’s work on micropolitics is put into conversation with the transformative movement-building current. The epistemological assumption undergirding this article is that textual political theory, and the knowledge being produced by activists, can benefit from dynamic exchange. My argument is that Connolly’s post-Nietzschean political theory offers a powerful justification for the political importance of mind/body practices, one that adds to activist justifications. I also argue that transformative movement-building contributes to recent theoretical debates by concretely demonstrating the integral importance of micropolitics for successful macromovements.},

Children were administered tests at the end of each school year to assess their abilities to perform rehearsed music, sight-read, play from memory, play by ear, and improvise. The students' mothers were interviewed in order to calculate how much each subject had practiced his or her instrument. Information was also obtained to help clarify the quality of mental strategies children adopted when performing. The sophistication of children's mental strategies provides an important means for understanding why some progress effortlessly while others struggle and fail. The importance of helping students develop a repertoire of task-appropriate strategies is highlighted.},

Specifically, the study considered students' attention to precision when critiquing a peer's work. The comprehensive definition of productive disposition used included task values (interest, utility), an ability belief (efficacy), three personal achievement goals, and negative emotions. As hypothesized, the 61 students who provided a more precise critique reported higher productive disposition (in particular, significantly higher mastery-approach personal achievement goals and less frequent negative emotions) than the 79 students who provided a basic critique. These findings illustrate how productive disposition can inform assessments of mathematical competence within the CCSSM recently implemented across the United States.},

This literature review examines the evidence base on one potential means for improving the course completion and learning outcomes of developmental mathematics students: reforming mathematics classroom pedagogy. Each study examined for this review was classified into one of six sets according to the main instructional approach focused on in the study. The six sets are: "student collaboration", "metacognition", "problem representation", "application", "understanding student thinking", and "computer-based learning". Because most of the studies across the sets did not employ rigorous methods, the evidence regarding the impact of these instructional practices on student outcomes is inconclusive. An analysis of the studies that did employ rigorous designs suggests that structured forms of student collaboration and instructional approaches that focus on problem representation may improve math learning and understanding. This paper concludes by making a number of methodological recommendations, proposing several needed areas of research related to developmental math pedagogy, and suggesting instructional practices that may improve the outcomes of developmental math students. A tabular review of math pedagogy studies is appended. (Contains 10 footnotes and 1 table.)},

The misconception is highly resistant to change and is remarkably similar to one discussed by Galileo, as shown by comparison of his writings with transcripts from student interviews. The source of this qualitative misunderstanding can be traced to a deep‐seated preconception that makes a full understanding of Newton’s first and second laws very difficult. In such cases learning becomes a process in which new concepts must displace or be remolded from stable concepts that the student has constructed over many years.},

By tracing the recent history of no borders activism in relation to the intensification of neoliberalism, and the prevalence of diffuse models of power, the analysis illustrates the ways in which critical praxis has been limited by the current milieu. Working from an anti-racist feminist perspective I utilize examples drawn from no borders activism to demonstrate the very real limits of informal and incidental learning in social movements. The analysis argues against the supplanting of consciousness with subjectivity as a way to avoid the problems associated with structuralist analysis. Instead, I have suggested that critical education for social action requires a dialectical engagement with the social relations that we live in, contest and transform.},

The 'contested present' (1970s-2011) examines the attack on progressive education in schools in line with economic downturn from the 1970s onwards and contrasts this with the strengthening of the early childhood movement in the 1990s. The 'uncertain future' (2012- ) looks at how current government policy is continuing to marginalise progressive ideals in favour of market-led educational decision-making but how educators are reclaiming the progressive space with the support of the wider community.},

Bruner's work has been enormously influential in the subfields of cultural psychology and psychological anthropology, especially because of his important contributions to our understanding of the intimate relationship between culture and mind. We examine Bruner's past and ongoing engagement with such luminary figures as Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Alfred Kroeber, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Clifford Geertz to highlight points of convergence and tension between his version of cultural psychology and contemporary theorizing and practice in psychological anthropology. We also review his practical and theoretical contributions to the fields of medicine, law, and education. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  title = {A Revised Theoretical Framework for the Role of Communities of Practice in Learning and Knowledge Sharing within a Geographically Dispersed Organization in an Emerging Economy in {{Latin America}}},
  url = {http://eprints.glos.ac.uk/2737/},
  abstract = {This thesis is about communities of practice [hereafter: CoPs], learning and knowledge sharing within the geographically dispersed organization Komatsu in Chile, which is an emerging economy in Latin America. Chile is characterised by a unique cultural and macroeconomic context and thus particularly suitable to broaden the scope about CoP theory. The research questions revolve around the forms that CoPs take within this context as-well-as their contribution to learning and knowledge sharing.
The literature review sheds light on the aspects of learning, knowledge sharing and CoPs in a comprehensive manner. It suggests that it is unsuitable to think of a single CoP that spans across geographically dispersed organizations, but rather to consider multiple interconnected CoPs. The boundary processes constitute the pivotal aspect in fostering learning and knowledge sharing among them.
This exploratory case study about shovel maintenance within Komatsu Chile, conducted within the social constructionism paradigm, provides evidence that CoPs are organised within a hierarchically-structured network. Extending beyond the premise that CoPs are bound together by shared practice (Brown \& Duguid, 1991, 2001b), the research puts forward the argument that CoP Glue, (meaning a reified abstraction, known and accepted throughout the network of CoPs) constitutes the mechanism that holds them together. As part of the revised theoretical framework, it is advocated that CoP Alterity, along the dimensions of practice, domain and community (Wenger, 2011), is the aspect according to which CoPs can be differentiated.
This revised theory opens up an interesting field of future academic enquiry. From a practitioner perspective the research has generated interesting findings and suggestions, which ought to be considered by those wishing to enhance learning and knowledge sharing within geographically dispersed organizations.},

  abstract = {Focusing on the fundamental role of language in creating and developing ideas, beliefs and norms, the current paper revolved around the processes of emergence of ideological norms. Through five major assumptions, it was argued how commonalities and cohesion in beliefs may involve shared goals and intentionality to create hegemonic ideological norms. In addition to the role of collectivity and the mechanism of social normalization to establish the consistent ideological norms, it was demonstrated that educational system is a major context through which socially shared intergroup belief systems (ideological norms) develop. To create these norms, educational system functions through a four-stage process including performing, appraising, forming and norming. Finally, based on the power and the properties of language, it was argued that critical theories may help educational system, particularly in research, practice and evaluation areas, to modify hegemonic ideological norms.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the notion of the assessment of ‘learning power’ as an important station in a mentored learning journey, which begins with the motivation and identity of the person who is learning, and moves through the awareness and development of the power to learn, to the publicly valued competencies and funds of knowledge of the formal curriculum. The seven dimensions of learning power are described, and the article reports on the findings of a qualitative study in which sixteen teachers were provided with learning power assessment data for their students as individuals and as whole groups. There were ten pedagogical themes which underpinned the teaching and learning encounters in those classrooms; these are briefly described. Learning power profiles have been used with nearly nine thousand students since 2003 and data from school-based development projects are referred to. The article concludes that the dynamic assessment of learning power serves three pedagogical purposes. First, it reflects back to the learner what they say about themselves in relation to their personal power to learn. Second, it reflects back to the teacher data about individuals, and groups, which can be used for diagnosing what is needed to move forward in the development of self-awareness, ownership and responsibility for learning. Third, it provides scaffolding for ways in which the students encountered the formal content of the curriculum. All of these operate together through the shared, and sometimes locally created, language stimulated by the learning dimensions, and through metaphors, icons and heroes which carry meaning in the classroom.},

However, this work has yet to become an integral part of educational psychology. This article first presents Vygotsky's unique view of cognitive development, followed by the central framework of his theory—the stages of sign use/concept development. These stages are also the stages of self-regulation/mastery of one's thinking and they culminate in the development of higher mental functions. Also discussed are current conceptions of self-regulation, a comparison with Vygotsky's view, and the implications of Vygotsky's thinking for curriculum and instruction.},

The empirical research reviewed illustrates (a) the application of institutional analyses to investigate schooling as a cultural process, (b) the application of interpersonal analyses to examine how interactions promote cognition and learning, and (c) discursive analyses examining and manipulating the patterns and opportunities in instructional conversation. The review concludes with a discussion of the application of this perspective to selected contemporary issues, including: acquiring expertise across domains, assessment, educational equity, and educational reform.},

  abstract = {Abstract:  Recent left academic work on the consequences of economic restructuring and local labour market change in old industrial cities has been important in emphasising the role of local context and contingency in the shaping of labour market outcomes. However, in such accounts agency is often limited to capital and state actors, albeit working across scales from the local upwards. There is little sense of agency for individuals and communities in the midst of economic restructuring. Instead, they are usually treated as passive victims of deeper underlying processes. In this paper, our purpose is to highlight the autonomy and agency of workers, people and communities in old industrial cities. Rather than starting from the perspective of capital, our starting point is to emphasise how those experiencing economic change forge strategies and practices for “getting by”. This leads us to call for a re-theorisation of labour agency, drawing upon the Autonomous Marxist tradition and the more recent work of Cindi Katz, in order to offer fresh insight into the agency of labour and the prospect for recovering a class politics based upon lived experience over reified abstractions.},

  abstract = {The French Revolution has often been perceived as the dawn of the modern era, the divide between the ancien régime and the contemporary world. It is an undeniably crucial event in the history of Western Civilization. Yet it is also a confusing and oft-misunderstood event. This comprehensive examination of the Revolution provides students with a narrative historical overview, essays on major aspects of the event, lengthy biographical profiles of key persons, the text of important primary documents contemporary to the time, a timeline, a glossary, and an annotated bibliography of print and electronic sources suitable to students. This is an ideal starting point for students and general readers interested in this fascinating historical period.Marsha and Linda Frey, noted French historians, place the French Revolution in historical and social context for the reader. In addition to a historical overview, other essays explore the deterioration of the ancien régime and the birth of the revolution, the Terror, the culture of the Revolution, Revolution-era diplomacy, and the ambiguous legacy of the Revolution. Biographical portraits range from Louis XVI to Robespierre and from Danton to Lafayette. Primary documents such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man, excerpts from the memoirs of French minister Miot de Melito, and Englishman William Eden's description of Revolutionary France bring to life the political, cultural, and emotional upheaval that was the French Revolution. Illustrations from contemporary sources add a valuable visual component to this all-in-one reference source.},

  abstract = {In most cultures, play seems to matter a great deal to young children. This is evidenced by the vast amount of time children spent playing and the combination of often unsurpassed passion, imagination, and energy which they invest in this activity. This paper explores why play matters through the lens of Bakhtin’s dialogic approach combined with Vygotsky’s developmental theory. In expanding upon their insights into a framework termed “the transformative activist stance,” we suggest that play offers unique opportunities for children to develop and exercise their agency, identity, and voice. While playing, according to this perspective, children discover how to be agentive actors—that is, unique persons who have an irreplaceable role in co-authoring social interactions, communal practices, and the world itself. In this complex endeavor, children sort out the difficult challenge of becoming unique, self-determined, and free persons within the communal world shared and co-created with others. Examples from video recordings of children’s interactive play in a naturalistic setting illustrate how play paves the way for children to collaboratively create and transform the world from their unique stances and positions. This approach suggests that play is serious work for children as they develop capacities for agency. Therefore, it is critically important that early education allocates ample time for this activity.},

  abstract = {In this paper we initially address the main categories of Marxism, illustrating how Vygotsky has appropriated them as mediational meta-theoretical tools for building concepts for his psychological approach. In order to investigate the influence of Marxism in cultural studies of science education, we make an account of how current research, sustained by Vygotsky’s original and successor theories, has been appropriating meta-theoretical categories of dialectical materialism. Once we identified Cultural Studies of Science Education as a journal that would probably concentrate papers that follow these perspectives, we decided to take it as the context of this study. In the process of selecting the corpus to be reviewed from the editions published from 2006 to 2011, we have found that 16 \% of the articles that matched keywords denoting frameworks related to the Vygotskian tradition developed and appropriated the categories of dialectical materialism. The quality and originality of contemporary development of CHAT denote that this framework has been playing a very important role in recent expansion of Vygotskian approaches to research in science education. Among the papers that we considered to develop and appropriate Vygotskian frameworks, incompletion in the appropriation of meta-theoretical categories of dialectical materialism and the misusage of dialectics intertwined with dialogism were highlighted. Our findings suggest that overcoming these limitations can enhance political analysis of sociocultural phenomena in the context of science education. It also represents a strengthening of the role of dialectical materialism in expanding sociocultural perspectives toward a better articulation between individual and institutional-centered analyses.},

Life‐span development was shown to be a “wave” process with spectral characteristics determined by anatomy. The frontal regions exhibited different wave characteristics than posterior regions, similarly, the left and right hemispheres exhibited differential developmental features. The establishment of corticocortical connections with different regions of the frontal lobes were shown to sequentially occur and to dominate postnatal cerebral development from birth to age 16.},

Two future directions are suggested by this work. The first is a call for measurement research to clarify the nomological network of various measurements of self-regulation and executive functions across a variety of methods and procedures. The second new direction is to broaden the analysis of executive function to include a wider array of predictive adaptive responses to various environmental conditions, including those where youth are chronically marginalized or otherwise stressed. Findings from these studies suggest that the executive functions within the brain guide adaptation in both deviant as well as competent responses to the social environment. Understanding various forms of adaptation will enhance the potential for prevention as well as avoid iatrogenic intervention strategies with misinformed targets.},

New York: Springer Science + Business Media, 2011; Young, Malingering, feigning, and response bias in psychiatric/psychological injury: Implications for practice and court. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Springer Science + Business Media, 2014). The model is a lifespan one that is not only consistent with and integrates the prior models on which it is based but also integrates and often explains better the data that had been used in building the prior models. In Young ( Development and causality: Neo-Piagetian perspectives. New York: Springer Science + Business Media, 2011), I explicated how the current 25-step model that I created accounts for the data used by both Fischer and Case in their Neo-Piagetian models and is comprehensive to the point that it fills in gaps in their (sub)stage sequences. Presentation of these arguments is beyond the scope of the present work. In this first chapter of five devoted to my model, I integrate prior material to show that the model includes descriptions of biological, personal (psychological, self), and environmental/social components at each step. For example, at the biological level, it gives the presumed evolutionary phase in which the step might have evolved and the presumed brain organization that might subserve it. At the personal/psychological/self level, it refers to the cognitive (mis)perception of the other that develops at each step. As for the environmental/social side, I give the social self working schemata that might develop in response to the social environment. The chapter considers some cognitive applications of the model especially in terms of the growth in two more advanced cognitions.

  abstract = {Proposes a framework for skill acquisition that includes 2 major stages in the development of a cognitive skill: (1) a declarative stage in which facts about the skill domain are interpreted and (2) a procedural stage in which the domain knowledge is directly embodied in procedures for performing the skill. This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from previous learning theories. How these learning mechanisms apply to produce the power law speedup in processing time with practice is discussed. (62 ref)},

  abstract = {This article uses a classroom episode in which a teacher and her students undertake a task of proving a proposition about angles as a context for analyzing what is involved in the teacher's work of engaging students in producing a proof. The analysis invokes theoretical notions of didactical contract and double bind to uncover and explain conflicting demands that the practice of assigning two-column proofs imposes on high school teachers. Two aspects of the work of teaching--what teachers do to create a task in which students can produce a proof and what teachers do to get students to prove a proposition--are the focus of the analysis of the episode. This analysis supports the argument that the traditional custom of engaging students in doing formal, two-column proofs places contradictory demands on the teacher regarding how the ideas for a proof will be developed. Recognizing these contradictory demands clarifies why the teacher in the analyzed episode ends up suggesting the key ideas for the proof. The analysis, coupled with current recommendations about the role of proof in school mathematics, suggests that it is advantageous for teachers to avoid treating proof only as a formal process.},

This study extends their work, on a small scale, to investigate 8th-grade mathematics teaching in yet another country, Italy. Eleven Italian lessons, from urban and rural schools in northern Italy, were videotaped, translated, transcribed, and analyzed following the same procedures used in TIMSS. They were then compared with German, Japanese, and U.S. lessons videotaped in TIMSS. Analyses revealed Italian lessons to be relatively homogeneous among themselves, yet distinct from those in the other cultures. In particular, Italian lessons were found to include a unique activity, not observed in other countries, in which students and teachers interact at the blackboard, with the rest of the class as the audience. Interviews with Italian education professionals investigated the roots of this activity and supported the cultural nature of Italian teaching. Cross-cultural studies of teaching are useful for revealing practices hidden within a culture and for finding alternative ways of teaching.},

Two pictures of the instruction and its results emerged from the study. On the one hand, almost everything that took place in the classroom went as intended—both in terms of the curriculum and in terms of the quality of the instruction. The class was well managed and well taught, and the students did well on standard performance measures. Seen from this perspective, the class was quite successful. Yet from another perspective, the class was an important and illustrative failure. There were significant ways in which, from the mathematician's point of view, having taken the course may have done the students as much harm as good. Despite gaining proficiency at certain kinds of procedures, the students gained at best a fragmented sense of the subject matter and understood few if any of the connections that tie together the procedures that they had studied. More importantly, the students developed perspectives regarding the nature of mathematics that were not only inaccurate, but were likely to impede their acquisition and use of other mathematical knowledge. The implications of these findings for reseach on teaching and learning are discussed.},

  url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0v779550},
  abstract = {A growing collaboration between psychologists, neuroscientists, and educators has culminated in the emergence of a new academic discipline known as Mind, Brain and Education (MBE). MBE differs from previous efforts, such as educational neuroscience, in that it is focused on the problem of how we might bring findings from the learning sciences into the classroom. As such MBE is placed squarely in the classroom, and works through engaging teachers as primary participants. Hence, MBE must work through an awareness of the systems of education and within the current context of educational policy and practice if it is to find a firm grounding in educational reform. In many ways the goals of MBE are in alignment with the voices of educational leaders across the globe. Pedagogical approaches referred to as neuropedagogy or neuroeducation, emphasize the development of high level cognitive capacities, such as critical thinking and creativity and address the connection between motivation, emotions, sleep, stress, circadian rhythms and development in learning processes. The primary purpose of this study was to define the emerging field of MBE with respect to its goals, vision and potential to serve as a significant framework for education reform. Because the basic constructs of the field are still being developed, interviews with expert members of the MBE community, including academic researchers, consultants and other educational leaders were conducted using a grounded theory approach. The definition of MBE was highly complex, but contained central elements relevant to reform. Special attention to developing a curricular model of MBE resulted in a vision of a holistic approach centered on developmental and individual needs of the students. To further investigate the possible impact of neuroeducation on student outcomes, two existing curricular models-- Waldorf and International Baccalaureate, were examined as examples of programs of neuropedagogy/neuroeducation. Findings indicated that examining curricular models currently in use holds promise for understanding the impact of the principles of neuroeducation on student outcomes and development and can serve as a first step towards developing a proof of concept for the field},

The review discloses a learning process that needs to recognize to a greater degree the significant influence of context, the varying nature of the catalyst of the process, the minimization of the role of critical reflection and increased role of other ways of knowing and relationships, and an overall broadening of the definitional outcome of a perspective transformation. Research needs to continue, particularly in the areas of cultural diversity, the fostering of transformative learning in the classroom, and the nature of and relationship between critical reflection and other ways of knowing. Designs of research including other methods beyond interviews, such as observations and content analysis in an ongoing educational context, would also be valuable.},

The concepts of content, process, and premise reflection have often been cited, and operationalizing Mezirow’s high-level transformative learning theory and its components has been the endeavor of adult education and human resource development (HRD) researchers. By conducting a literature review, we distill 12 research studies on critical reflection that we dissect, analyze, and compare. Discovering different approaches, assessment processes, and outcomes leads us to the conclusion that there is little agreement on how to operationalize reflection. We suggest four improvements: (a) integrating different critical reflection traditions, (b) using multiple data collection pathways, (c) opting for thematic embedding, and (d) attending to feelings. By implementing these improvements, we hope to stimulate closer alignment of approaches in critical reflection research across adult education and HRD researchers.},

More specifically, it focuses on the period from the Society's inception in 1958 to the beginning of its relative decline in significance, which can be situated after the first election of Richard M. Nixon as president in 1968. The main focus of the thesis lies on challenging more traditional classifications of the JBS as an extremist outcast divorced from the American political mainstream, and argues that through their innovative organizational methods, national presence, and capacity to link up a variety of domestic and international affairs to an overarching conspiratorial narrative, the Birchers were able to tap into a new and powerful force of largely white suburban conservatives and contribute significantly to the growth and development of the post-war New Right. For this purpose, the research interrogates the established scholarship and draws upon key primary source material, including official publications, internal communications and the private correspondence of founder and chairman Robert Welch as well as other prominent members.},

The authors trace this concept from the philosophical crisis bequeathed by Kant to his successors, to its development by the central figures of the Athenaeum group: the Schlegel brothers, Schelling, and Novalis. This study situates the Jena romantics fragmentary model of literature a model of literature as the production of its own theory in relation to the development of a post-Kantian conception of philosophy as the total and reflective auto-production of the thinking subject. Analyzing key texts of the period, the authors articulate the characteristics of romantic thought and at the same time show historical and systematic connections with modern literary theory. Thus, The Literary Absolute renews contemporary scholarship, showing the romantic origins of some of the leading issues in current critical theory."},

  abstract = {In the course of the long 18th century, basic conceptual and discursive changes took place in the western world. Even words which remained the same took on new meanings.The new concepts indicate how the social reality is comprehended in the modern era. Various segments of the population relied on them to act, to understand, interpret and reform reality.These concepts are crucial to the discursive constitution of the world. They take part in the dissolution of the ‘old’ world and the emergence of a ‘new’ one.They do not merely reflect structural patterns; they accompany and stimulate an ongoing transition process.This article deals with a small aspect of the historical co-evolution of concepts and structures in education. It examines the non-random character of the variations in the discourses on the social function of education. It offers an analysis of the changing relationship between education, politics and economy in that period. It analyzes how different conceptualizations of the function of education are both a factor in, and an indicator of, the morphogenesis of the modern educational system.},

To a surprising extent, these views are based upon highly simplified characterisations of university history. The claims in question have been repeated so often that they have become clichés. Historical research has challenged all these conventional claims. The article aims to acquaint readers with the most important of these challenging results. Central here is an analysis of The Humboldt Myth about the rise of the modern research university in Germany and its alleged export to the US, and of the reasons why that myth remains so powerful, even though it has very little relation to realities on the ground. A second goal is to try to bring out some of the implications that a revision of standard views of higher education history might have for current policy debates, focusing in particular on the Bologna process.},

The interaction among the state, the church, and societal groups was a critical determinant of the form these systems took. Where the state was formally allied to a national church, it was able to create a national educational system early. In the absence of such a state-church linkage, outcomes depended on the roles of societal groups. Where such groups were actively involved in schooling, enrollments expanded early but the state found it difficult to construct a single national system. Where societal groups did not mobilize around education, compulsory schooling laws were enacted early, but because of the state's organizational weakness, these laws were not realized in the growth in enrollments.},

  abstract = {The goal of this essay is to analyse the influence of Johann Bernhard Basedow and Rousseau on Kant’s cosmopolitanism and concept of cosmopolitan education. It argues that both Basedow and Kant defined cosmopolitan education as non-denominational moral formation or Bildung, encompassing—in different forms—a thin version of moral religion following the core tenets of Christianity. Kant’s encounter with Basedow and the Philanthropinum in Dessau helps to understand the development of Kant’s concept of cosmopolitanism and educational theory ‘in weltbürgerlicher Absicht’. Rousseau’s role is more complex: he clearly influenced Kant; he is usually considered a precursor of modern nationalism and national education; and recent studies have stressed the cosmopolitan dimension of his educational programme. I claim that the dilemma of education according to Rousseau is that one has to choose between education of homme or education of citoyen, and that there is no way to avoid or go beyond this stark alternative. Kant’s reinterpretation of Rousseau is favourable and creative and has found many followers up to the present, but is misleading, as he ignores the dilemma and imposes his own conception of cosmopolitanism, of cosmopolitan education and of (possible) progress in history on Rousseau while claiming that this was actually Rousseau’s message.},

Comparing TAPG-centred networks of cognitive praxis with the broader and more integrated pro-capitalist policy-planning network that is integral to the hegemonic bloc, the study considers whether TAPGs contribute to transnational class formation in ways that are analogous to hegemonic policy groups. Findings support the claim that TAPGs serve as 'collective intellectuals' facilitating construction of a counter-hegemonic bloc that transects national borders and poses democratic alternatives to neoliberal globalization. The article briefly considers the challenges TAPGs face in this construction project.},

The first model posits that global civil society is coopted by hegemonic capitalist and political elites, and promotes hegemonic interests by distributing neoliberal values and providing a façade of opposition. The second model views global civil society as the infrastructure from which counter-hegemonic resistance, and ultimately a counter-hegemonic historic bloc will evolve and challenge neoliberal hegemony. The predictions that these two views make as to the structure of global civil society networks are tested through network analysis of a matrix of links between 10,001 international NGOs in a purposive sample of INGOs extracted from the database of the Union of International Associations. The findings provide partial support to the predictions of both models, and lead to the conclusion that at present global civil society is in a transitional phase, but that the current infrastructure provided by the global INGOs network is conducive to the development of a counter-hegemonic historic bloc in the future, providing the northern bias in network is decreased. Strategic steps needed to achieve this are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper maps out the potential of a Gramscian conceptualisation of global civil society for understanding global resistance to neoliberal globalisation and contemporary global governance. First, the principal features of contention between contemporary representations of global civil society in studies of global resistance are examined. A predominant focus on perpetuating the division between normative and empirical conceptualisations is reoriented towards a Gramscian conceptualisation which, it is argued, affirms the emancipative potential of global civil society in global resistance. Initiating a dialogue between concept and reality (Cox, 1999)—also referred to as the ‘dialectical nexus’ (Gramsci, 1971)—offers alternative possibilities for the substantive analysis of global civil society in relation to global resistance. This moves Gramscian civil society towards a conceptual grounding which deals with the formation, negotiation and re-negotiation of transversal hegemony and recovers, and emphasises, the role of human agency within the global political economy. Este artículo expone el potencial de una conceptualización gramsciana de la sociedad civil global, para entender la resistencia global a la globalización neoliberal y la gobernanza global contemporánea. Primero, se han examinado las principales características de controversia entre las representaciones contemporáneas de la sociedad civil global, en los estudios de la resistencia global. Un enfoque predominante en perpetuar la división entre las conceptualizaciones normativas y empíricas, está reorientado hacia una conceptualización gramsciana, de la cual se sostiene, que afirma el potencial tendiente a ser libre de la sociedad civil global, en la resistencia global. Con el inicio de un diálogo entre concepto y realidad (Cox 1999)—también referido como el ‘nexo dialéctico’ (Gramsci, 1971)—ofrece posibilidades alternativas para el análisis sustantivo de la sociedad civil global en relación a la resistencia global. Esto hace avanzar a la sociedad civil gramsciana hacia un fundamento conceptual que se ocupa de la formación, negociación y la renegociación de la hegemonía transversal y recupera y enfatiza el rol de la agencia humana dentro de la economía política global. 为了理解对新自由主义全球化和当代全球治理的全球抵制,本文勾勒全球公民社会的葛兰西主义概念化的潜在意义。第一,在关于全球抵制的研究中,本文探讨了公民社会的当代代表性之间争论的主要特征。主流的聚焦规范和实证的概念化之间分野的固化被重新定位,以趋于葛兰西主义的概念化,此种概念化被认为是肯定了在全球抵制中全球公民社会解放的潜在意义。倡议概念与现实之间的对话(考克斯,1999)——也指向诸如“辩证的相互联系”(Gramsci, 1971)——为与全球抵制有关的、对全球公民社会的实质分析提供了替代的可能性。这使得葛兰西主义的公民社会趋于一种概念性的基础,而这种基础论及横切的霸权的构成、谈判和再谈判,以及复原、强化全球政治经济中的人类行动的作用。 تسعى هذه الدراسة إلى استكشاف ما ينطوي عليه مفهوم غرامشي بشأن المجتمع المدني العالمي من إمكانات تساعد على فهم المقاومة العالمية للعولمة ذات الطابع النيوليبرالي والحكم العالمي المعاصر. وتبحث الدراسة أولاً الملامح الأساسية للتضارب بين التعبيرات المعاصرة عن المجتمع المدني العالمي في الدراسات المتعلقة بمقاومة العولمة. وتعيد الدراسة النظر في التركيز الغالب على ترسيخ الفصل بين المفاهيم المعيارية والإمبريقية، وذلك من أجل التوصل إلى مفهوم من منطلق غرامشي يؤكد، حسبما ترى الدراسة، على الإمكانات التحررية للمجتمع المدني العالمي في إطار المقاومة العالمية. ومن شأن إقامة حوار بين المفهوم والواقع (Cox, 1999)، والذي يُشار إليه أيضاً بتعبير "العلاقة الجدلية" (Gramsci, 1971)، أن يوفر إمكانات بدي\&\#x6 이 글은 신자유주의적 세계화와 지구적 거버넌스에 대한 지구적 저항을 이해하기 위하여 그람시적인 지구적 시민사회 개념의 잠재성을 살펴본다. 먼저, 지구적 저항에 대한 연구에서 지구적 시민사회의 재현들에서 나타나는 논쟁들의 주요 내용이 검토된다. 규범적 개념화와 경험적 개념화 간의 구분을 지속시키는데 맞추는 지배적인 초점을 지구적 저항에서 지구적 시민사회의 해방적 잠재력을 확인시키는 그람시적인 개념화로 다시 돌린다. 개념과 현실간의 대화(Cox, 1999)를 주도하는 것은 – 또한 ‘변증법적 연쇄’(Gramsci, 1971)로 지칭되는-지구적 저항과의 관련 속에서 지구적 시민사회의 실체적 분석을 위한 대안적인 가능성을 제공한다. 이것은 그람시적인 시민사회 개념을 지구적 정치경제 안에서 횡단하는 헤게모니의 형성, 협상과 재협상을 다루고 그리고 인간 행위자의 역할을 재발견하고 강조하는 개념적 정초로 나아가게 한다.

Whereas environmental degradation was once seen as imposing a limit on economic accumulation, in the new 'green economy', ecologism appears to become a rationale for extending market activity. The intensification of neoliberal extraction, and corresponding social and environmental debt, meets resistance from the global justice movement whose articulation of a counter position is increasingly sophisticated. This article examines this dialectic as played out at the UN Rio + 20 Summit and parallel People's Summit in June 2012. The hegemonic 'green economy' formulation of corporations, multilateral agencies, unions, and big NGOs is contained in a document known as The Future We Want. A counter-hegemonic document entitled Another Future is Possible, facilitated by the World Social Forum, spells out an alternative route to global justice and environmental sustainability—a 'bio-civilisation'. In neo-Gramscian terms, a war of position is occurring between two 'transnational historic blocs around divergens social visions (Carroll, 2007, p. 36).},

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {In his twelfth thesis On the Concept of History from 1940, Benjamin states: “The subject of historical cognition (Erkenntnis) is the struggling, oppressed class itself. Marx presents it as the last enslaved class—the avenger that completes the task of liberation in the name of generations of the downtrodden” (SW 1: 394). In the preparatory notes on the Theses, he adds a further clarification: “This subject is certainly not a transcendental subject, but the struggling, oppressed class in its most exposed situation. There is historical cognition for them (this class) only and for them only in a historical instant.” Although Benjamin clearly distinguishes the subject of historical cognition from Kant’s non-historical transcendental subject, it is the wager of this paper that the epistemo-political scope of Benjamin’s historical-materialist concept of history becomes legible only against the dual backdrop of Marx and Kant. If the “struggling, oppressed class” takes the position of the Kantian transcendental subject, the political-economic standpoint and historicity of this collective subjectivity coalesces with its cognizing vantage point in a transcendental sense. I will argue that Benjamin maintains the basic structure of Kant’s transcendental argument, yet expands and radicalizes it by grounding transcendentality in a constellation of historical time punctuated by class struggle. In this way, historical cognition is not structured by ahistorical transcendental forms but always already imprinted by a “historical index” (AP: N 3,1), which is bound to the experience of a political subject at a particular time. Ultimately, if the subject of historical cognition is the struggling, oppressed class in its exposedness to a specific historical situation, class struggle is the ‘small gate’ through which the realm of true historical cognition can be entered. As we shall see, historical cognition is not a given knowledge, something that can be possessed and scientifically produced, but an ability, which is present in class struggle and presents itself only to those who are caught in this struggle.},

  abstract = {Charles Sanders Peirce was born in September 1839 and died five months before the guns of August 1914. He is perhaps the most important mind the United States has ever produced. He made significant contributions throughout his life as a mathematician, astronomer, chemist, geodesist, surveyor, cartographer, metrologist, engineer, and inventor. He was a psychologist, a philologist, a lexicographer, a historian of science, a lifelong student of medicine, and, above all, a philosopher, whose special fields were logic and semiotics. He is widely credited with being the founder of pragmatism. In terms of his importance as a philosopher and a scientist, he has been compared to Plato and Aristotle. He himself intended "to make a philosophy like that of Aristotle." Peirce was also a tormented and in many ways tragic figure. He suffered throughout his life from various ailments, including a painful facial neuralgia, and had wide swings of mood which frequently left him depressed to the state of inertia, and other times found him explosively violent. Despite his consistent belief that ideas could find meaning only if they "worked" in the world, he himself found it almost impossible to make satisfactory economic and social arrangements for himself. This brilliant scientist, this great philosopher, this astounding polymath was never able, throughout his long life, to find an academic post that would allow him to pursue his major interest, the study of logic, and thus also fulfill his destiny as America's greatest philosopher. Much of his work remained unpublished in his own time, and is only now finding publication in a coherent, chronologically organized edition. Even more astounding is that,despite many monographic studies, there has been no biography until now, almost eighty years after his death. Brent has studied the Peirce papers in detail and enriches his account with numerous quotations from letters by Peirce and by his friends. This is a fascinating account of a p},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore Peirce's work for insights into a theory of learning and cognition for education. Our focus for this exploration is Peirce's paper The Fixation of Belief (FOB), originally published in 1877 in Popular Science Monthly. We begin by examining Peirce's assertion that the study of logic is essential for understanding thought and reasoning. We explicate Peirce's view of the nature of reasoning itself—the characteristic guiding principles or ‘habits of mind’ that underlie acts of inference, the dimensions of and interaction between doubt and belief, and his four methods of resolving or ‘fixing’ belief (i.e., tenacity, authority, a priori, and experimentation). The four methods are then juxtaposed against current models of teaching and learning such as constructivism, schema theory, situated cognition, and inquiry learning. Finally, we discuss Peirce's modes of inference as they relate educationally to the resolution of doubt and beliefs and offer an example of belief resolution from an experienced teacher in a professional development environment.},

  abstract = {abstract For Kant, the ideal of enlightenment is most fundamentally expressed as a self-developed soundness of judgment. But what does this mean when the judgment at issue is practical, that is, concerns the good to be brought about through action? I argue that the moral context places special demands on the ideal of enlightenment. This is revealed through an interpretation of Kant's prescription for moral pedagogy in the Critique of Practical Reason. The goal of the pedagogy is to cultivate the moral disposition, and the method consists of training in judgment. Unfortunately, Kant seems to wind up somewhere short of this goal, leaving the young person with only an idle wish for a properly cultivated moral disposition. In this paper, I argue that when we address the special issues that arise when the enlightenment ideal is brought to bear on practical judgment-issues that stem from the intrinsic connection between practical judgment and agency-we will see that there is no lacuna in Kant's account.},

In this paper I briefly explore both the history of those relationships and representations of the working classes within dominant discourses, before moving on to outline some of the consequences of contemporary educational policy for working-class subjectivities. I do this by drawing on data from three research projects: one on higher education choice; one on transitions to secondary schooling; and a third on assessment in primary schools. However, working-class relationships to education cannot be understood in isolation from middle-class subjectivities so I also try to begin to map out some of the unconscious aspects of class that implicate both middle- and working-class subjectivities.},

Data from research conducted at Boston College over 30 years highlight 4 issues: high stakes, high standards tests do not have a markedly positive effect on teaching and learning; high stakes tests do not motivate the unmotivated; authentic high stakes assessments are not a more equitable way to assess the progress of students who differ in race, culture, native language, or gender; and high stakes testing programs have been shown to increase high school dropout rates, particularly among minority populations. The paper emphasizes the need to carefully monitor the four issues. Though raising educational standards and improving educational quality in American schools is important, efforts to foster academic achievement must involve more than simply setting demanding standards and mandating examinations that are referenced to them.},

  abstract = {The book's goal is to clarify for parents, the public, and policy makers what high stakes tests are and how their use affects our schools, children, and society. It explores the various uses, limitations, and paradoxical consequences of high stakes testing. The present context of testing and the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind make the proposed book timely and important. Current testing programs provide valuable information to teachers, parents, and policy-makers about students, schools, and school systems. But paradoxically, these programs have unintended yet predictable negative consequences for many students, teachers, and schools. It is essential that the public and policy-makers understand the scope and impacts that result from the inherent paradoxical nature of high-stakes testing. Testing is viewed by policy makers across party lines as an "objective" measure of student attainment and has become their tool of choice to drive educational "reform" and hold children, teachers, schools, and districts accountable. Bipartisan support for test-based accountability is firm. For example, on January of 2005 President Bush called on Congress to extend NCLB testing in math and science to freshmen, sophomores and juniors citing poor performance among high school students as a "warning and a call to action." (NYT 01/ 13/05) Senator Kennedy, a critic of the President, nonetheless supported the President's proposed high school testing provisions.},

In this study, student self-regulated learning strategies in problem-based learning and project-based learning environments were examined to determine whether student self-regulation outcomes differed depending on the instructional design. Quantitative results showed that student motivations and behaviours were not statistically different in the two settings. Differences in cognitions associated with self-regulated learning were, however, observed in the two settings, with students in the project-based environments reporting higher levels of elaboration, critical thinking and metacognition. In addition, students in the project-based courses reported higher perceived autonomy support, or the degree to which they perceived their instructors provided them with supportive opportunities to act and think independently compared to students in the problem-based courses. These findings indicate that different non-traditional student-centred learning environments may support different outcomes related to self-regulated learning.},

Autonomous motivation for teaching was predicted to be associated positively with teachers' sense of personal accomplishment and negatively with emotional exhaustion. Most important, teachers' self-reported autonomous motivation for teaching was expected to promote students' self-reported autonomous motivation for learning by enhancing teachers' autonomy-supportive behavior, as indicated by students' reports. Results from a sample of 132 Israeli teachers and their 1,255 students were consistent with the hypotheses. Discussion focuses on the importance of the experience of autonomous motivation for teaching for teachers and students.},

In §1, I conclude that the forms of reflexivity and associated stances towards society that Archer defines can be seen as developments of the different forms of attachment, which personal relations theory can account for. This raises questions about the relationship between attachment-based notions of psychological health and reflexivity-based approaches to social transformation. I suggest a way in which this might be investigated empirically. In §2, I note similarities and differences between Archer's work and personal relations theory. To illustrate the personal relations approach I describe a model first developed by Donald Davidson, and what Cavell calls ‘the dialectic of the first and third person views of the self’ to account for personal transformation between stances and the move towards mature dependency as described by Ronald Fairbairn. I suggest that Archer's and Fairbairn's models could be directly related if Archer's model is seen as equivalent to Fairbairn's notion of the central self under mature dependence. I argue that a critical realist account of both the psychological and social selves would require both models.},

The concept of a pedagogical nexus illustrates how different parts of a system work together, how actors shape this and are influenced by it, and the implications of this for pedagogical change. The article therefore also explores how global goals and targets and their monitoring interact with other parts of the system and may affect teaching and learning in unintended ways.

  shorttitle = {â��{{When}} a Dam Burstsâ��},
  abstract = {This thesis addresses the inability of existing approaches in the field to reach an adequate understanding of social movements. It shows existing approaches to be reliant on a civic conception of social movements (articulated as a relationship between individual and state), overly-reliant on a priori theorising and frequently foreclosing the content of social movement activity. It argues that at the heart of the problem is the presentation of the political internal to these perspectives â�� as a representational practice. Moreover, it is a principal contention of this thesis that social movement behaviour proves difficult to account for is because it challenges and undermines this presentation. Anarchist literature provides both the means to understand â�� in the form of the objections to idealisation, abstraction and determinism in political thought â�� as well as the foundations to address â�� in the objectives of a de-alientated intellectual enquiry and a unique view of the political â�� this issue. It also provides the outline for the development of a unique methodology to the study of social movements. It was the aim not only to establish new and better methods for documenting and analysing social movements but also seek to apply this to a particular case study, the December unrest in Greece of 2008, in an attempt to provide a richer, more holistic account of these events.},

  abstract = {$<$div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"$>$$<$p$>$BACKGROUND$<$/p$>$$<$p$>$ Hegel\&apos;s philosophy is an attempt to renew classical philosophy, especially the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, within the modern philosophical tradition begun with Kant. Hegel\&apos;s ethical thought is no different from the rest of his philosophy in this respect. Classical ethical theory, culminating for Hegel in the ethical theory of Aristotle, saw ethics as aiming at a single final end or human good, called “happiness” [eudaimonia). By nature, human beings have a characteristic function; to fulfill that function is to be happy. Aristotle defined happiness as the actualizing of the soul\&apos;s capacities in accordance with the excellences appropriate to them, and most especially the actualization of its highest capacity, reason. Our rational excellences include both theory and practice; practical excellences include not only the intellectual virtue of practical wisdom but a range of distinct moral virtues of character. Moral virtues dispose the non-rational part of our soul, which includes desires and feelings, to be governed by the rational part, so that our wants, likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains, all harmonize with reason. $<$/p$>$$<$/div$>$},

  abstract = {$<$div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"$>$$<$p$>$BACKGROUND$<$/p$>$$<$p$>$ Shortly after Hegel\&apos;s death, the influence of his philosophy began to wane. Part of this process involved the division of Hegel\&apos;s followers into what David Friedrich Strauss (1808-1874) called “right,” “center,” and “left ” Hegelians. Strauss himself may be regarded as the founder of the “left”  Hegelian school with his book The Life of Jesus (1835). At first the battleground was theological. “Right ” Hegelians, such as H. F. W. Hinrichs (1794-1861) and Johann Erdmann (1805- 1892), employed Hegel\&apos;s philosophy in defense of traditional Christianity, “center” Hegelians, such as Karl Rosenkranz (1805-1879) and Karl Ludwig Michelet (1801-1893), subjected religious dogma to Hegelian reinterpretation; and “left” Hegelians, such as Strauss, Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872), and Bruno Bauer (1809-1882), derived theologically radical (even atheistic and humanistic) conclusions from Hegelianism. Yet Strauss borrowed the terminology of “left”  and “right” from French politics, and from the beginning the division was implicitly over social and political as well as theological issues. Left Hegelianism was explicitly linked to political radicalism and the communist worker\&apos;s movement by Moses Hess (1812-1875) in The European Triarchy (1841).$<$/p$>$$<$/div$>$},

Seamus Carey uses anecdotes from his own experience as a parent, some amusing and some poignant, to illustrate philosophical concepts. The result is a rare work, as valuable to the serious student of philosophy as it is to Carey's fellow parents. Carey argues that parents need to rediscover the sense of wonder—the ontological depth—with which children experience life, and offers suggestions for how this recovery might take place. In so doing, Carey uncovers standards and ideas for raising children that reach beyond those typically considered by the modern family.},

Whereas for some, the main role of universities is to provide professional and vocational education and training and their benefits are to be measured in terms of social or economic utility, their value for others is to be seen more in terms of the liberal development and promotion of certain intrinsically worthwhile qualities of mind and intellect. In this context, indeed, much recent literature on university education has been concerned to reaffirm what are usually taken to have been the liberal purposes of bygone university education over the more instrumental or vocational agendas of much contemporary university and higher education. While recognising, along with other treatments of this issue, that it is to some extent implicated in a false dichotomy between the liberal and the vocational, this paper seeks a clearer rationale for the liberal dimensions and aspirations of university education.},

A context specific approach to the study of alienation is proposed which perhaps will enable sociologists to continue to concern themselves with the study of structurally induced disaffection while avoiding some of the problems common to past research.},

A thesis of the book is that knowing is rooted in the direct experience of meaningful environmental objects and events present in individual-environment processes and at the level of collective, social settings.  Ecological Psychology in Context: *traces the primary lineage of Gibson's ecological approach to William James's philosophy of radical empiricism; *illuminates how the work of James's student and Gibson's mentor, E.B. Holt, served as a catalyst for the development of Gibson's framework and as a bridge to James's work; *reveals how ecological psychology reciprocally can advance Jamesian studies by resolving some of the theoretical difficulties that kept James from fully realizing a realist philosophy; *broadens the scope of Gibson's framework by proposing a synthesis between it and the ecological program of Roger Barker, who discovered complex systems operating at the level of collective, social processes; *demonstrates ways in which the psychological domain can be extended to properties of the environment rendering its features meaningful, publicly accessible, and distributed across person-environment processes; and *shows how Gibson's work points the way toward overcoming the gap between experimental psychology and the humanities.  Intended for scholars and students in the areas of ecological and environmental psychology, theoretical and historical psychology, cognitive science, developmental psychology, anthropology, and philosophy.},

Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

The problem is to justify why one particular reason rather than another is specified as causally efficacious. It is argued that the problem arises independently of one’s preferred conception of singular causal claims, psychological and psychophysical generalizations, and our folk-psychological competence. The proposed fallibilist solution involves the supplementation of the reason given by narratives that contextualize it and provide additional criteria for justifying the causal claim. It is argued that narratives have a distinctive structure that can afford the justification of causal attributions without sui generis powers of narrative explanation having to be invoked.},

  abstract = {Around the globe a great emphasis has been placed upon improving public service delivery by reforming and enhancing professionalism. The impact and significance of the associated changes have been much debated with a focus on issues of de- and re-professionalisation, and demarcations of expertise and work. Professionals and professionalism remain the central focus while service users and non-professionals still tend to be positioned as ‘other’: their roles tending to be taken into account, but as additional rather than essential to service provision. By contrast, this article sets out a modest proposal to consider the relational configurations of actors involved in public services drawing upon certain dynamics of amateurism. This article suggests that the dynamics of doing something ‘for the love of it’, supported by the ‘passion to learn’ of autodidactism, provide the basis for rethinking some of the assumptions made and issues faced when addressing the challenges of the public services. Drawing upon historical and contemporary illustrations of the contributions of amateurism to professional practice, this article argues for the need to explore possibilities beyond existing binary of professional–amateur.},

Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group in IT Education Conference, 16–18 October 2008, Cincinnati, OH) in which we used a survey-based instrument, the Personal Responsibility Orientation Self-Directed Learning Scale – PRO-SDLS (Stockdale, S.L., \& Brockett, R.G. (2006). The continuing development of the PRO-SDLS: An instrument to measure self-direction in learning based on the personal responsibility orientation model. Paper presented at the 20th International Self-Directed Learning Symposium, Cocoa Beach, FL), as a new perspective to measure the impact of innovative approaches in the teaching of computer programming in online courses. The data have been collected during the offering of an undergraduate online asynchronous programming course delivered in 2008 at the University of South Florida Polytechnic. Our primary pedagogical intervention has been the use of peer learning forums which attempt to (1) leverage peer learning dynamics in an online course, (2) help students better structure their work on a weekly basis, and (3) help them learn to engage actively with the material (e.g., exercises, reading assignments). This article studies the impact of peer learning forums on these students through the lens of various instruments. Some, such as the PRO-SDLS, are well established in the self-directed learning literature. Others are introduced in this article to provide a more complete picture of both the students' self-perception of their self-direction and its more observable aspects. We also identified intrinsic characteristics of our student population, which we believe to have a significant impact on these instruments' measures. Finally, we relate these data to student feedback obtained through more open question surveys. These observations, made using diversified instruments, on a small and well-characterized learner population, represent the foundation of our case study. Our findings suggest that, after using the peer learning forums for an entire semester, the self-perception of our over-committed online adult learners' ability for self-directed learning has evolved to realign itself with more observable manifestations of their self-direction.},

  abstract = {This paper consists of two parts. The first part gives an overview of two major paradigms which have influenced research in education; the positivist/empiricist and the interpretive. It is argued that research into self‐direction has been dominated by the positivist/empiricist paradigm and that, because of a fundamental incompatibility between the assumptions underlying positivism and those underlying ‘self‐direction,’ research into self‐direction has been ‘blocked.’ It is suggested that the adoption of an interpretive paradigm promises to reinvigorate and redirect research into self‐direction in learning. The second part of the paper represents an attempt to develop a research agenda into self‐direction from an interpretive perspective; that is, one which takes account of the learner's subjective construing of the learning situation. This subjective construing includes pur elements: (1) the learner's view of learning in general; (2) the learner's view of the specific learning endeavour being researched; (3) the learner's view of assistance or direction received; and (4) the learner's view of autonomous leaming and the development of personal autonomy. It is also suggested that any adequate research into ‘self‐direction’ should ideally take account of the perspective of the facilitator or other person offering help and assistance, since learning situations depend largely on the quality of the relationship established between the learner and the ‘helper’.},

The findings indicate that the students were successful in building a wide range of LEGO/Logo machines, from simple to complex models, and that the peer teachers were utilized as experts by the other students and benefited from this experience.

To get the best from them for education we need to start with the requirements of education, in terms of both learners’ and teachers’ needs.

However, the problem with their line of argument is that IL and PBL approaches are highly scaffolded. In this article, we first demonstrate that Kirschner et al. have mistakenly conflated PBL and IL with discovery learning. We then present evidence demonstrating that PBL and IL are powerful and effective models of learning. Far from being contrary to many of the principles of guided learning that Kirschner et al. discussed, both PBL and IL employ scaffolding extensively thereby reducing the cognitive load and allowing students to learn in complex domains. Moreover, these approaches to learning address important goals of education that include content knowledge, epistemic practices, and soft skills such as collaboration and self-directed learning.},

It is a normative theory that departs in its construction from an empirical facticity without reducing norms to facts. It unifies teleological and deontic considerations. It is a theory of the normatively requisite institutional structures able to realize the demands of a historically particular form of individuality, and simultaneously it presents the phenomenology of modern subjectivity committed to the ultimate value of true freedom. In this way it aims to transform into genuine self-knowledge the illusory social-political self-image of its addressees. The paper discusses the connection between this phenomenological method and Hegel's conception of freedom - his critique of unconditional, abstract normativity, his solution to the problem of collision between equally valid norms and the possible relevance of his methodological principles to contemporary political philosophy.},

  abstract = {The article argues that the terminology of Hegelian logic is not as far removed from the English philosophical tradition as is generally believed. The article also examines sociologist Karl Marx's use of social thinker Georg W.F. Hegel's logic while he was at work in 1858 on the Grundrisse manuscripts, so that the reasoning behind an essential part of his critical theory of capitalist society is laid bare. The two-fold character of labour and the theory of surplus value together represent Marx's ultimate answer to the problems about profit. According to Marx the capitalist system is not in equilibrium. He claims that it has an in-built tendency to collapse because of the necessity to produce ever-increasing profits.},

Rousseau wrote treatises on education and politics as well as novels and operas, and as one of the most influential and controversial of the Enlightenment thinkers, he inspired the leaders of the French Revolution. His memoir is regarded as the first modern autobiography, in which the writer defined his life mainly in terms of his worldly experiences and personal feelings. These memoirs constitute the main source of Rousseau's reputation as a leader in the transition from eighteenth-century reason to nineteenth-century romanticism. His emphasis on the effects of childhood experiences anticipates the psychology of Sigmund Freud, and his conviction that the individual is worthy of account forms a major contribution to progressive social and political thought. The book has inspired many imitations in autobiography, fiction, and poetry, and it has influenced the works of Proust, Goethe, Tolstoy, and countless others.},

He attempted to study and understand human society by using scientific methods of enquiry. However, Ibn Khaldun's name and contributions to modern sociology are apparently missing from most Western sociological textbooks in most universities across the globe. This article examines the sociological ideas of Ibn Khaldun and their relevance to contemporary sociology. The article considers factors responsible for why Ibn Khaldun has ceased to command a wide audience in contemporary mainstream sociology and suggests the need for modern sociologists and social scientists generally to begin to become acquainted and engage rigorously with his ideas and arguments.},

I seek to illuminate his contributions to the forging of an understanding that is both spiritual and material. While universalizing themes of importance in his cultural tradition, I pay particular attention to the role of the individual and the place of the group. Ibn Khaldun's attention to group identity is one reason why his understanding of human beings is vital to a creative synthesis of tradition and (post)modernity.},

Mental models, as representations of the reality being investigated in inquiry learning, stand to influence strategies applied to the task. In the research described here, the hypothesis is investigated that students at the middle school level, and sometimes well beyond, may have an incorrect mental model of multivariable causality (one in which effects of individual features on an outcome are neither consistent nor additive) that impedes the causal analysis involved in most forms of inquiry learning. An extended intervention with 6th to 8th graders was targeted to promote (a) at the metalevel, a correct mental model based on additive effects of individual features (indicated by identification of effects of individual features as the task objective); (b) also at the metalevel, metastrategic understanding of the need to control the influences of other features; and (c) at the performance level, consistent use of the controlled comparison strategy. Both metalevel advancements were observed, in addition to transfer to a new task at the performance level, among many (though not all) students. Findings support the claim that a developmental hierarchy of skills and understanding underlies, and should be identified as an objective of, inquiry learning.},

It is expected that this way of learning fosters students’ motivation and interest in science, that they learn to perform steps of inquiry similar to scientists and that they gain knowledge on scientific processes. Starting from general pedagogical reflections and science standards, the article reviews some prominent models of inquiry learning. This comparison results in a set of inquiry processes being the basis for cooperation in the scientific network NetCoIL. Inquiry learning is conceived in several ways with emphasis on different processes. For an illustration of the spectrum, some main conceptions of inquiry and their focuses are described. In the next step, the article describes exemplary computer tools and environments from within and outside the NetCoIL network that were designed to support processes of collaborative inquiry learning. These tools are analysed by describing their functionalities as well as effects on student learning known from the literature. The article closes with challenges for further developments elaborated by the NetCoIL network.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the `issue-oriented' perspective on public involvement in politics opened up by recent research in Science and Technology Studies (STS). This research proposes that public controversy around techno-scientific issues is dedicated to the articulation of these issues and their eventual accommodation in society. It does not, however, fully answer the question of why issue formation should be appreciated as a crucial dimension of democratic politics. To address this question, I turn to the work of two early 20th-century American pragmatists: John Dewey and Walter Lippmann. In their work on democracy in industrial society, they conceived of public involvement in politics as being occasioned by, and providing a way to settle, controversies that existing institutions were unable to resolve. Moreover, Dewey developed a `socio-ontological' understanding of issues, which suggests that people's involvement in politics is mediated by problems that affect them. Dewey and Lippmann thus provide important argumentative resources for further elaborating the approach to public involvement developed in STS. STS research has also developed a `socio-ontological' approach, as it focuses on the `attachments' that people mobilize (and that mobilize people) in the performance of their concern with public affairs. Such an approach provides an alternative to discursivist analysis of the role of `issue framing' in the involvement of publics in politics.},

  abstract = {An ambivalent, sometimes destructive, relationship between modern humanity, technology and ‘outer’ or external nature has historically attracted the critical attention of scholars and commentators from a wide variety of backgrounds. The effects of technology on postmodern ‘inner’ nature warrants similar scrutiny. This article examines how technology structures human experience and is structuring education for sustainable development. Propositions about the ‘technics of experience’ and questions for environmental education are posed so as to invite more earnest discussion about the inroads technologies and ‘vicarious’ learning experiences are making into the equally unproblematic ontological treatment of postmodern learners/subjects. Consideration must be given to the question of what users of the technological medium ‘become’—an ontological issue of crucial relevance to the ongoing aspirations and legitimacy of environmental education.},

  abstract = {This article calls for a re-conceptualization of the social sciences by asking for a cosmopolitan turn. The intellectual undertaking of redefining cosmopolitanism is a trans-disciplinary one, which includes geography, anthropology, ethnology, international relations, international law, political philosophy and political theory, and now sociology and social theory. Methodological nationalism, which subsumes society under the nation-state, has until now made this task almost impossible. The alternative, a ‘cosmopolitan outlook’, is a contested term and project. Cosmopolitanism must not be equalized with the global (or globalization), with ‘world system theory’ (Wallerstein), with ‘world polity’ (Meyer and others), or with ‘world-society’ (Luhmann). All of those concepts presuppose basic dualisms, such as domestic/foreign or national/international, which in reality have become ambiguous. Methodological cosmopolitanism opens up new horizons by demonstrating how we can make the empirical investigation of border crossings and other transnational phenomena possible.},

Sen's notion of ‘capabilities’ as the potential functionings to achieve well-being is interpreted here as a specification of the ontological category of ‘causal power’, presupposing an open system conception of reality that contrasts with much of contemporary economic practice.},

  abstract = {There is room for considerable cooperation between archaeology and neuroscience, but in order for this to happen we need to think about the interactions among brain–body–world, in which each of these three terms acts as cause and effect, without attributing a causally determinant position to any one. Consequently, I develop the term social ontology to look at how human capabilities of mind and body are brought about through an interaction with the material world. I look also at the key notion of plasticity to think about not only the malleable nature of human brains, but also the artefactual world. Using an example from the British Iron Age (approx. 750 BC–AD 43), I consider how new materials would put novel demands on the bodies and brains of people making, using and appreciating objects, focusing on an especially beautiful sword. In conclusion, I outline some possible areas of enquiry in which neuroscientists and archaeologists might collaborate.},
