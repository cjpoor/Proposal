## self-education as History Making

    ### Ancient Greece

        The concept of the self-education of humanity has been an underlying theme in the work of thinkers at least since Thucydides and Aristotle.

        With no previous example to build upon, the ancient Greeks taught themselves how to establish, maintain, and defend a democratic Polis.
        Ober analyzes the institutions and mechanisms developed and employed by the ancient Athenians to build and protect democracy (Knowledge and democracy, 2007).

        To what extent were these institutions supported by norms in Athenian culture?

            #### Autonomy in ancient Athens

            To a far greater degree than the Romans, the ancient Athenians considered individual autonomy to be an integral quality of a citizen. Athenian democracy was grounded on "an ideology of equality" (Konstan, 1995, Patrons and Friends). Ober notes that, in contrast to most other pre-modern societies, the elties generally had very little in the way of networks of private patronage (Knowledge, p.255).

            Castoriadis (1991, Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy) argues that, almost uniquely, the ancient Athenian culture "burst" open the bonds of institutionalized heteronomy, allowing the genuine development of the autonomous individual who was able, in turn, to act on society in the "self-alteration of the social world ... this relation appears during manifest and marked epochs of social-historical alteration when society and individuals alter themselves together, those alterations entailing each other ..." (p.146)


            >Starting with the psyche, using it, as it were, as a material, the instituted society each time makes the individuals-which, as such, can henceforth only make the society which has made them. It is only insofar as the radical imagination of the psyche seeps through the successive layers of the social armor, which cover and penetrate it up to an unfathomable limit-point, and which constitute the individual, that the singular human being can have, in return, an independent action on society. Let me note, in anticipation of what follows, that such an action is extremely rare and, at any rate, imperceptible wherever instituted heteronomy6 prevails­ that is, in fact, in almost all known societies. In this case, apart from the bundle of predefined social roles, the only ascertainable ways in which the singular psyche can manifest itself are transgression and pathology. Things are different in the rare case of societies where the bursting of complete heteronomy makes a true individuation of the individual possible and thus allows the radical imagination of the singular psyche to find or create the social means of publicly expressing itself in an original manner and to contribute perceptibly to the self-alteration of the social world. A third aspect of this relation appears during manifest and marked epochs of social-historical alteration when society and individuals alter themselves together, those alterations entailing each other in this case. (p.146)


        A section of the elite, however was always ambitious to impose their own rule, and in this they succeeded twice, though temporarily. Furthermore, political theorists and philosophers, from Plato to Robert Bellah and John Keane, have pointed to the dark side of democracy, warning of problems of hubris and oppression of minorities. What lessons can we learn from the Greek experience for our continuing self-education in defence of democracy today?

## Social Change

    ### Social change aligned with self-education of humanity

        The problematic of social change has always been central to social theory. I argue that social change is aligned with the self-education of humanity.

    ### Social movements and mechanisms of change

        Environmental vs communicative mechanisms Examples of "womens's liberation" "Environmentalism" and civil rights movements.

    ### Reconfiguring causal relationship between social and mental

        The reconfiguring of the causal relationship between the social and the efficacy of mental processes

    ### Interaction of the mental and social

        Ekström explains that the generative conception of causality in social science focuses on discovering causal properties underlying "the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions, meanings, intentions, social contexts and structures" and the social actions which result from this interaction. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

        This relates to "The causal efficacy of mental states" (Menzies, 2003)

    ### Autonomy, solidarity, collaboration, inquiry, efficacy

    ### Methodology of causally explanatory social theory

        Ekström poses the question as to what can we identify as the "scientific-theoretical and methodological foundations" of social theory directed toward causal explanations. (1992, Causal Explanation of Social Action, p.1)

## Bildung

    ### Herder's concept of Bildung

        Herder developed the concept of “self-cultivation (Selbst-Bildung)” within the notion of “cultivating mankind” through his reading of Shaftesbury, Leibniz, Montesquieu, Spalding, Möser, Wieland, and the authors Sterne and Richardson (Horlacher, 2004)

    ### Hegel's concept of Bildung

    ### Adorno's Bildungsidee

        For Adorno the Bildungsidee was a the understanding of the development of freedom through self-development consonant with Leibniz’s interpretation of Shaftesbury’s “character formation” as development of “inward form” or “innere Bildung” and Goethe’s authenticity and “self-creation” (Hermeling, 2003).

## Learning

    ### Vygotskyan conceptions of learning

        For Vygotsky it is by addressing, through collaborative activity, the problems encountered in daily life, that one develops oneself and becomes a knowledgeable member of a community (Blunden, 2015).

    #### Stetsenko’s theory of collaborative transformative practice

        (Stetsenko, 2008) is described (Sugarman & Sokol, 2012, pp. 6–8) in Stetsenko’s theory of a dialectic of collaborative transformation of the objective world and of subjectivity and inter-subjectivity. However, the concept of transformation here is akin that of Archer in that it is analogous to sculpting and does not refer to the transformation of the causal ontology of the world.

    ### Engeström’s conception of learning

    ### Bickhard’s interactivist model of learning

    ### Efficacy and ontology in education and social action

        See Martin, Sugarman & Hickinbottom, 2010, *Persons: Understanding Psychological Selfhood and Agency* regarding agency and the emergent ontology of persons.
